## Context & Hooks — `src/context/` + `src/hooks/`

### Contexts
- `StudentAuthContext` — stores `{ user, onboarded }` from localStorage, provides `login()`, `register()`, `logout()`
- `AdminAuthContext` — stores `{ admin }` from localStorage, provides `login()`, `logout()`
- `TestContext` — manages active test state (questions, answers, timer, mode) across SessionPage and ReviewPage

### Hooks
- `useLocalStorage(key, initialValue)` — read/write localStorage with React state sync
- `useTimer(seconds, onExpire)` — countdown timer for timed test mode
- `useRoadmapAdjuster(roadmap, onboarding)` — computes which days get extra sessions for student's weak subjects
- `useCountUp(target, duration)` — animates stat card numbers on mount

---
