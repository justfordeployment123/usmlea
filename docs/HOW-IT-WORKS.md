# How NextGen USMLE Works - Quick Reference

> **Full Details:** See `/docs/system-architecture.md`

## 🎯 The Big Picture

NextGen USMLE is a **self-adjusting** study platform. Everything works together in a continuous loop:

```
Roadmap guides → Tests validate → Results adapt roadmap → Repeat
```

---

## 🔄 The Core Loop

### 1. **Roadmap Sets the Plan**
- AI generates 12-week study schedule based on exam date
- Each day has assigned subjects + topics + hours
- Weak subjects (from onboarding) get extra practice sessions

### 2. **User Studies + Practices**
- Watches videos, reads PDFs
- Takes tests **linked to roadmap sessions**
- Tests auto-suggested based on today's topic

### 3. **Results Feed Back to Roadmap**
- Test scores → analyzed by AI
- Low performance (<75%) → roadmap adjusts
- Adds review sessions, reorders topics, extends timeline

### 4. **Dashboard Shows Everything**
- Current progress (score, streak, hours)
- Today's plan
- AI insights about weak areas
- Recent test results

---

## 📚 Question Bank: Smart Defaults

**What makes it smart:**

When user opens Question Bank, system says:
> "Based on today's roadmap: Pharmacology - CNS Drugs
> 40 questions, Timed mode"

**Why this matters:**
- One click to start relevant practice ✓
- Test results link to roadmap session ✓
- AI knows which topic was validated ✓
- Progress feels connected ✓

**User can always customize:**
- Choose different subjects
- Adjust question count
- Timed mode only (review at end)
- Filter by weak areas only

---

## 🧠 Test Mode

### Timed Mode (Practice)
- 1.5 min/question
- No instant feedback
- Review all at end
- Explanation text and video references appear only after submission/time expiry
- Best for: Building speed

### Mock Exam Mode (Assessment)
- 80 questions, 110 minutes
- Full exam simulation
- Comprehensive report
- Best for: Progress checks

---

## 🔄 How Adaptation Works

**Example:**

```
User takes "Immunology" test → Scores 55%
                ↓
AI analyzes: "Hypersensitivity Type IV is weak"
                ↓
AI decides: "Add review session + suggest video"
                ↓
Roadmap updates: Week 4, Day 5 → "Immunology Review"
                ↓
Dashboard shows: "AI Insight: Focus on Type IV..."
                ↓
User follows updated plan
```

**Adaptation triggers:**
- Score <75% on any topic
- Mock exam completed (weekly/biweekly)
- User marks topic as "too hard"
- User skips a day (reschedules content)

**What AI adjusts:**
- Adds review sessions
- Moves hard topics earlier (more time to practice)
- Extends total weeks if falling behind
- Reduces hours/day if burnout detected

## 🎓 AI Tutor: Context-Aware Help

**AI knows:**
- What you're studying today (from roadmap)
- Your recent test results
- Your weak subjects
- Which video you're watching

**Example interaction:**

```
User: "Why did I get this renal question wrong?"

AI: "You're currently on Week 3 - Renal Physiology.
     You confused Type III vs Type IV hypersensitivity.
     
     Type III = Immune complex (antibody-mediated)
     Type IV = T-cell mediated (delayed)
     
     Your test showed 2/5 on Type IV questions.
     Watch: 'T-Cell Immunity' at 14:22
     
     I've also added a review session to Week 5.
     
     Want me to explain the difference more?"
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Dashboard Level (Home Screen)
- Overall score (all-time correct %)
- QBank usage (questions used / total)
- Study streak (consecutive days)
- Weekly hours

### Roadmap Level (Study Plan)
- Current week / total weeks
- Sessions completed / remaining  
- Phase progress (Foundation → Integration → Practice → Mock)

### Subject Level (Analytics Page)
- Per-subject scores
- Topic mastery heatmap
- Weak areas flagged with recommendations

---

## 🗂️ Content Hub Integration

**Videos:**
- AI can **deep-link** to exact timestamps
- "Watch: Beta Blockers at 8:22"
- Clicking navigates to video + auto-seeks to 8:22

**PDFs:**
- AI retrieves page numbers
- "Source: Pharmacology Ch.4, Page 112"
- Clicking opens PDF at that page

**Diagrams:**
- AI shows **verified images** from content
- Never generates/hallucinates new images
- "Figure 4.2 - Beta-1 Receptor Pathway"
