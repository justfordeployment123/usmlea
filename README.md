## DOCUMENT REALITY STATUS (FRONTEND DEEP SYNC — 2026-04-20)

This README is the **full-system target specification** for backend implementation.
Current codebase reality is that frontend flows are implemented using simulated/local data, while backend remains to be built.

How to use this document for backend development:
- Treat Chapters 1–19 as the production target contract (data model, APIs, services, security, ops).
- Treat the frontend-current sections (especially Sections 20 and 21) as integration constraints and migration notes.
- Build backend contracts to preserve frontend route/component behavior while replacing dummy/local data paths with APIs.

Status labels used throughout this document:
- `[FRONTEND IMPLEMENTED (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]`
- `[FRONTEND PARTIAL (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]`
- `[BACKEND NOT IMPLEMENTED — BLUEPRINT ONLY]`

Chapter-level reality map:
- Ch. 1 → 10: `[BACKEND NOT IMPLEMENTED — BLUEPRINT ONLY]`
- Ch. 11 (Notes): `[FRONTEND PARTIAL (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` (UI exists, but no backend persistence yet)
- Ch. 12 (Student Analytics): `[FRONTEND PARTIAL (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` (route/UI/formulas implemented on mock attempts)
- Ch. 12 Real-Time Admin Monitoring plan: `[BACKEND NOT IMPLEMENTED — BLUEPRINT ONLY]`
- Ch. 13 (Video Progress): `[BACKEND NOT IMPLEMENTED — BLUEPRINT ONLY]`
- Ch. 14 (Document Progress): `[BACKEND NOT IMPLEMENTED — BLUEPRINT ONLY]`
- Ch. 15 (Admin Student Ops): `[FRONTEND PARTIAL (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` (admin pages + local/mock data)
- Ch. 16 (Admin Metrics/Financials/Comments): `[FRONTEND PARTIAL (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` (UI and analytics model exist; backend absent)
- Ch. 17 (Taxonomy Analytics): `[FRONTEND PARTIAL (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` (taxonomy-driven filtering exists in UI)
- Ch. 18 (Admin Announcements + Inbox): `[FRONTEND IMPLEMENTED (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` for UI/context/localStorage mode; backend not implemented
- Ch. 19 (Tiered Subscriptions + Demo Trial): `[FRONTEND IMPLEMENTED (SIMULATED/LOCAL DATA)]` for local entitlement engine + feature gating; backend not implemented

## CHAPTER 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & PLATFORM PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 The Vision
The NextGen platform is designed to be a premium, high-stakes educational environment for medical students preparing for rigorous examinations (such as the USMLE). It fundamentally relies on two unbreakable principles:
1.  **Absolute Zero Hallucination:** The AI features must never invent medical facts, guess physiological mechanisms, or generate inaccurate diagrams. 
2.  **Absolute Intellectual Property Protection:** Premium video and PDF resources are highly valuable. They must be aggressively protected from scraping, downloading, and unauthorized peer-to-peer sharing.

### 1.2 The User Journey
When a new user signs up, the system must feel completely alive and tailored to them:
- They are rapidly navigated through an onboarding matrix.
- Their study schedule is mathematically generated the moment they hit submit.
- As they study, their performance actively warps and morphs their future schedule.
- They are connected to peers in the background, without feeling forced into social networking.
- Their performance is constantly evaluated, gamified via a global leaderboard, and displayed in beautiful diagnostic matrices.

### 1.3 The Administrative Mandate
Simultaneously, the platform must allow Administrators to retain total control:
- Admins must be able to view global financial health instantly.
- Admins must have the power to eradicate abusive comments instantly across all users globally.
- Admins must have macro-level telemetry on system health.

---

## CHAPTER 2: THE DECOUPLED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

To achieve zero-latency AI responses while keeping hosting costs extremely low, the platform uses a heavily decoupled architecture.

### 2.1 The Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- **Framework:** React 18, Vite.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM (v6+).
- **Styling:** Modular CSS. Tailwind is explicitly avoided to maintain a unique, premium design system.
- **Hosting:** Vercel. 
- **Reasoning:** Vercel allows for global Edge-Caching, meaning the heavy React bundles load in under 50 milliseconds regardless of if the student is in New York or Tokyo.

### 2.2 The Backend API Gateway
- **Runtime:** Node.js powered by Express (TypeScript).
- **Hosting:** Render, Railway, or Heroku.
- **Functionality:** This layer intercepts all web traffic. It checks JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), processes Stripe webhooks, and manages the database transactions.

### 2.3 The Core Database (Supabase)
- **Engine:** PostgreSQL 15+.
- **Why Supabase?:** Supabase acts as the undisputed backbone because it natively provides the Relational Database, User Authentication, Video Storage, and crucially, `pgvector` all inside a single managed dashboard.

### 2.4 The Caching Layer (Redis)
- **Role:** High-speed, in-memory caching.
- **Usage:** PostgreSQL will crash if 50,000 students query a leaderboard simultaneously. Redis handles the high-throughput scoring logic smoothly.

### 2.5 The AI Inference Engine (Groq)
- **Model:** `llama3-70b-8192`.
- **Infrastructure:** LPUs (Language Processing Units).
- **Reasoning:** ChatGPT wrappers are slow and expensive. Groq processes LLM tokens nearly 10x faster than traditional GPUs, providing an instant real-time chat experience for the student, at almost zero cost.

---

## CHAPTER 3: THE SUPABASE DATABASE SCHEMA (SQL)

You must explicitly implement these tables in your Supabase PostgreSQL instance.

### 3.1 Authentication & Tiers
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

CREATE TYPE role_type AS ENUM ('student', 'admin');
CREATE TYPE subscription_tier AS ENUM ('demo', 'basic', 'standard', 'premium');

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role role_type DEFAULT 'student',
    tier subscription_tier DEFAULT 'demo',
    target_exam VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'USMLE Step 1',
    exam_target_date DATE NOT NULL,
    stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, 
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### 3.2 Roadmap Tables
```sql
CREATE TYPE session_status AS ENUM ('upcoming', 'completed', 'missed', 'skipped');

CREATE TABLE roadmap_sessions (
    session_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    scheduled_date DATE NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    topic VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    estimated_duration_minutes INT NOT NULL,
    status session_status DEFAULT 'upcoming',
    is_ai_remediation BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, 
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_roadmap_user_date ON roadmap_sessions(user_id, scheduled_date);
```

### 3.3 Analytics & Test Attempts
```sql
CREATE TABLE test_attempts (
    attempt_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    subject VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
    target_topic VARCHAR(255),
    total_questions INT NOT NULL,
    correct_answers INT NOT NULL,
    score_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ((correct_answers::numeric / total_questions) * 100) STORED,
    taken_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3.4 Community Content
```sql
CREATE TABLE premium_content (
    id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    content_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    supabase_storage_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE video_comments (
    comment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    video_id VARCHAR(100) REFERENCES premium_content(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    likes INT DEFAULT 0,
    is_hidden BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    posted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3.5 The RAG Vector Database
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE knowledge_embeddings (
    chunk_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    source_filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(150),
    raw_content TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding VECTOR(1024), 
    verified_image_storage_url VARCHAR(500) 
);

CREATE INDEX knowledge_embedding_idx ON knowledge_embeddings USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

---

## CHAPTER 4: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) ALGORITHMS

The AI must only answer questions based on official medical PDFs. 

### 4.1 Ingestion Logistics
1.  **Uploading Phase:** Admins upload verified clinical PDFs (e.g., *Pathophysiology Core Concepts*).
2.  **Extraction:** The Node.js server utilizes `langchain.js` `PDFLoader` to rip the raw text from the document.
3.  **Semantic Formatting:** The text is passed into `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. 
    -   *Chunk Size:* 1000 characters.
    -   *Overlap:* 200 characters.
    -   *Why?* Medical concepts span multiple sentences. Overlap ensures that a sentence explaining a disease mechanism is not disconnected from the preceding sentence describing its symptoms.
4.  **Embedding Generation:** Each chunk is passed to an Embedding model (e.g., HuggingFace `bge-large-en`). The model returns a massive array of numbers `[0.012, -0.45, ...]`.
5.  **Storage:** This vector array is inserted into the `knowledge_embeddings` SQL table.

### 4.2 The AiTutor Chat Engine (Live Inference)
When a student types a question in the React Chat UI, here is the chronological workflow:
1.  **Frontend Dispatch:** React sends a POST request with the text `"Explain Heart Failure"`.
2.  **Vector Calculation:** The Node.js backend converts `"Explain Heart Failure"` into its own Vector mathematical array.
3.  **Cosine Similarity:** The backend runs a Supabase RPC function checking the student's vector against the millions of chunks in `knowledge_embeddings`. It fetches the Top 3 "Closest" textbook paragraphs.
4.  **Groq Injection:** The backend connects to Groq API.
5.  **Hard Guardrails:** The system prompt forces constraints:
    -   *System Prompt:* `"You are a medical examiner. You MUST answer the user's question using ONLY the following verified textbook context. DO NOT hallucinate. [Textbook Paragraphs 1, 2, 3]"`
6.  **Instant Delivery:** Groq processes the answer in ~400ms and sends it down to the React frontend.

### 4.3 Verified Visuals
Because AI models are notorious for drawing physically inaccurate body organs when asked to generate images, we strictly bypass AI Image Generation.
-  When a textbook paragraph is put into the database at Step 1, it is tagged manually with a corresponding diagram URL directly from the AWS/Supabase storage bucket.
-  When the React Context Panel updates, it simply parses that URL and renders `<img src={...} />`.

---

## CHAPTER 5: THE ADAPTIVE ROADMAP ALGORITHMS

The Roadmap algorithm is highly responsive to student performance.

### 5.1 The Genesis Matrix
When the student inputs an exam date 90 days away, the algorithm divides those 90 days using the real-world USMLE weighting rubric. 
-   If Pathology is 20% of the USMLE, 20% of the 90 days (18 days) is assigned to Pathology topics.
-   The backend loops 90 times, inserting chronological rows into `roadmap_sessions`.

### 5.2 The "Ghost Protocol" (Compressing Missed Days)
If a student disappears for 3 days due to illness:
1.  A midnight server-side **Cron Job** executes.
2.  It queries `roadmap_sessions` looking for rows where `date < TODAY` but `status = 'upcoming'`.
3.  It updates those rows to `status = 'missed'`.
4.  It automatically finds dates ahead of 'TODAY' tagged as "Rest Days" and re-allocates the missed subject material explicitly into the future. This prevents the student's final exam date from being illegally delayed.

### 5.3 The Intervention Algorithm (Failing Grades)
1.  A student submits an MCQ test. The Node server calculates a score of **45%**.
2.  Because the score is `< 60%`, the backend halts normal operations and initiates an Intervention.
3.  It queries the upcoming timeline for a date where `SUM(estimated_duration_minutes) < 180` (A day with less than 3 hours of studying).
4.  It explicitly injects a new row: `INSERT INTO roadmap_sessions (topic, is_ai_remediation) VALUES ('REMEDIATION: Failed Concepts', TRUE)`.
5.  In the React frontend, the UI spots `is_ai_remediation = TRUE` and morphs the HTML, rendering a glaring RED intervention block to catch the user's eye.

---

## CHAPTER 6: GLOBAL GAMIFICATION AND ANALYTICS

Current frontend reality snapshot:
- Leaderboard and analytics views exist in UI routes, but are driven by local/mock datasets.
- No Redis integration exists in current frontend code.
- No backend leaderboard fetch path is wired yet.
- Student analytics formulas are implemented client-side in `frontend/src/pages/student/AnalyticsPage.tsx`.

### 6.1 The Leaderboard Engine (Redis)
Ordering 50,000 students via SQL `ORDER BY points DESC` destroys relational database performance. 
-   **Awarding XP:** When a task is marked 'completed', the backend fires an `O(1)` command to Redis: `ZINCRBY nextgen_global_board 50 user_uuid`.
-   **Fetching Ranks:** `LeaderboardPage.tsx` asks the server for the board. The backend runs `ZREVRANGE nextgen_global_board 0 49` to fetch the top 50, and `ZREVRANK nextgen_global_board user_uuid` to fetch the student's specific hidden rank natively.

### 6.2 The Dashboard Diagnostics
To populate the circular CSS Donut Rings in `DashboardPage.tsx`:
1.  The backend runs a massive aggregation query in SQL calculating `AVG(score_percentage)` for every specific `target_topic` logged by the student.
2.  If the average score for Cardiology is 84, the server returns the Float `84.0`.
3.  The React app natively places the value into the `stroke-dashoffset` parameter dynamically, calculating the exact geometry required to draw a circle spanning 84% of its perimeter.

---

## CHAPTER 7: PEER MATCHMAKING ENGINE

Current frontend reality snapshot:
- Study partners UX is implemented in `frontend/src/pages/student/StudyPartnersPage.tsx`.
- Matching and connected lists are loaded from static data (`frontend/src/data/students.ts`).
- Consent/reveal behavior is simulated locally in component state.
- No backend matchmaking, scheduling job, or encrypted contact exchange is currently wired.

In `StudyPartnersPage.tsx`, mentors and peers are paired optimally.

### 7.1 The Distance Heuristics Matrix
A Cron Job executes every night at 3:00 AM UTC. It loops through all `users` where `opt_in_matchmaking = TRUE` and derives a Compatibility Score (Max 100).
1.  **Temporal Proximity (40 pts):** Calculate the absolute difference between Exam Dates. Ex: `Score = MAX(0, 40 - (DaysDiff * 2))`.
2.  **Schedule Alignment (30 pts):** If User A and User B both prefer `Evening` study hours, award 30 points.
3.  **The Symbiotic Exchange (30 pts):** If User A's weakest documented subject matches User B's strongest subject, they receive 30 points, fostering ideal peer-tutoring.

### 7.2 The Consent Handshake
Contact numbers are physically encrypted in the database.
-   When matched, the frontend renders a blurred identity card.
-   If User A and User B concurrently click `Accept`, the backend executes `user_a_consent = TRUE` and `user_b_consent = TRUE`. The next API fetch decrypts their raw phone numbers for external communication.

---

## CHAPTER 8: FIN-TECH & INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SECURITY

The absolute core of the business is the Content Hub. We cannot let an unentitled/demo user access premium videos. 

### 8.1 JWT Roles & Stripe Webhooks
1.  When a user completes plan checkout on Stripe, Stripe fires a POST request to your backend `/api/v1/webhooks/stripe`.
2.  The backend confirms cryptographic signatures from Stripe.
3.  It updates the database table directly: `UPDATE users SET tier = 'standard'` (or chosen paid plan).
4.  The user's next authenticated login issues them a secure JWT explicitly carrying the current plan payload.

### 8.2 Security Guard Middleware
Every request from the React app sends this JWT. Your Express API intercepts the request immediately.
-   If the API routes to `/api/v1/content/videos` and reads a plan without required grants (e.g., `tier='demo'`), the API abruptly terminates the call with a `403 Forbidden` status. The database is never even queried.

### 8.3 The Self-Destructing Media Files
If a premium student tries to scrape a video and leak the URL online:
1.  The Node.js backend does not send the raw generic URL holding the video file.
2.  Instead, the Node.js backend commands Supabase Storage to cryptographically mint a "Signed URL".
3.  The Signed URL represents a highly specific, encrypted link parameterized to explode.
4.  The server sets `Expires: 3600`.
5.  In exactly 60 minutes, the Signed URL permanently terminates. If the student reposted the link to Reddit, it will result in an "Access Denied" error for anyone attempting to view the pirated material.

---

## CHAPTER 9: THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMAND CENTER (OVERSIGHT & MODERATION)

Current frontend reality snapshot:
- Admin routes implemented: `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/students`, `/admin/metrics`, `/admin/financials`, `/admin/comments`, `/admin/announcements`, `/admin/billing`.
- Admin authentication is localStorage-based demo auth (`admin@nextgen.com` / `admin123`) via `AdminAuthContext`.
- Metrics/financial panels are currently simulation-first (local data + derived frontend models), not live backend telemetry.
- Comment moderation supports `visible|hidden` toggling in frontend demo mode with local action-history state.

The Admin Portal (`/admin`) is a completely separate high-security environment designed for platform owners to manage the business, monitor system health, and enforce community standards. It is composed of multiple high-performance modules.

### 9.1 The Executive Dashboard (Global Telemetry)
The Admin Dashboard provides a bird's-eye view of the entire NextGen ecosystem. It does not focus on individual users, but on system-wide health.
- **Key Metrics:** It tracks total active students, server uptime, and AI inference latency.
- **Data Pipeline:** These stats are pulled from a combination of the PostgreSQL `users` table count and a **Telemetry Service** that logs Every time a student interacts with the Groq API.
- **UI Logic:** We use high-contrast "Status Cards" that glow Green when systems are healthy and Pulse Red if the AI response time exceeds 1.5 seconds, allowing Admins to spot infrastructure bottlenecks immediately.

### 9.2 Student Management (The CRM Hub)
The **Students** tab serves as the platform's internal CRM. It allows administrators to search, filter, and drill down into every registered account.
- **User Records:** Displays the student's name, email, subscription tier, and "Last Active" timestamp.
- **Administrative Actions:** From this UI, an Admin can manually override a student's tier (e.g., granting temporary `premium` access for support reasons), reset passwords, or ban users who violate terms of service.
- **Architecture (production target):** This page should use a scalable server-side pagination strategy and can optionally use virtualization for very large datasets.

### 9.3 The Financials Engine (MRR & LTV Tracking)
This is the most critical business module. To maintain 100% accounting accuracy, it bypasses the local database and queries the **Stripe API** directly in real-time.
- **Metric 1: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Calculated by aggregating active paid plans (`basic`, `standard`, `premium`) via Stripe subscription state and internal subscription snapshots.
- **Metric 2: Churn Rate:** The system monitors `customer.subscription.deleted` webhooks to track how many students are leaving vs. joining, displayed as a percentage.
- **Metric 3: Lifetime Value (LTV):** An algorithmic estimation of how much a student will pay over their entire time on the platform.
- **Visualization:** Data is piped into **Custom CSS Bar Charts** that allow the Admin to see growth trends over 30, 60, and 90-day windows.

### 9.4 The Moderation Hub (Security & Safety)
The Moderation Hub is where the Admin enforces the platform's professional standards. It specifically targets the **Community Discussion** threads beneath every video.
- **Real-Time Feed:** It surfaces every new comment posted globally into a centralized list.
- **One-Click Obfuscation:** Next to every comment is a "Hide Access" toggle. When clicked, the Node.js backend updates the `is_hidden` column in the `video_comments` table.
- **The Cloaking Mechanism:** Once hidden, the comment is not deleted (to preserve legal records of abuse), but it is "Cloaked." On the student-facing side, the React component replaces the text with: `[This comment was hidden by an administrator for violations of community guidelines.]`
- **Flagged Content:** Any comment containing "Banned Words" (defined in a server-side regex list) is automatically moved to the top of this list and highlighted in orange for immediate Admin review.

---

## 10. CONCLUSION `[BLUEPRINT SUMMARY]`

## 11. NOTES PERSISTENCE CONTRACT

Current frontend reality (`frontend/src/pages/student/NotesPage.tsx`):
- Notes editor UX is implemented.
- Data source is seeded in-memory from `frontend/src/data/notes.ts`.
- Save/Pin/Delete currently update component state only (no API and no persistent storage layer yet).

Backend should store note text in markdown form to preserve formatting and derive a plain text field for search.

Required fields in notes table:
- note_id as UUID primary key
- user_id as UUID foreign key to users
- title
- subject (default General)
- content_markdown as source of truth
- content_plain as stripped searchable text
- content_json as optional rich text JSON for future editor upgrades
- is_pinned
- created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

## 12. STUDENT ANALYTICS PAGE — FULL FRONTEND/BACKEND/DB CONTRACT

This section defines the complete architecture for the Student Analytics page (`/student/analytics`) including tab behavior, filter logic, backend contracts, data modeling, and aggregation formulas.

Current frontend reality snapshot:
- Analytics scope uses fixed exam context from `mockRoadmapContext` and does not expose exam switching in student UI.
- Primary data source is `MOCK_STUDENT_ATTEMPTS` with client-side filtering/aggregation.
- Taxonomy filter UI is live and enforces dependent reset behavior (`subject -> topic`).
- No analytics API transport is currently wired.

### 12.1 Product Intent

The Student Analytics page must answer three practical questions for a learner:

1. **Overview:** “Am I improving over time?”
2. **Strengths & Weaknesses:** “Which subjects/topics are weak right now?”
3. **History:** “What exactly did I attempt recently and what type of test was it?”

The page is scoped to the learner’s fixed target exam and then filtered by subject/topic.

---

### 12.2 Frontend Information Architecture

Route: `/student/analytics`

Current implementation files:
- `frontend/src/pages/student/AnalyticsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/student/analytics/TrendCharts.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/student/analytics/PerformanceHeatmap.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/taxonomy/TaxonomyFilterBar.tsx`

Tabs:
- **Overview**
    - KPI cards: average score, questions answered, streak days, total hours
    - Trend charts: score trend, performance by subject, study hours by week
- **Strengths & Weaknesses**
    - Heatmap (subject × topic) with color buckets
    - Weakest-cell summary text
- **Test History**
    - Recent attempts list with date, subject/topic focus, test type, score, duration

---

### 12.3 Taxonomy Scope Rules (Student Side)

Student analytics scope is intentionally constrained:

- **Exam:** fixed from the student exam context (not editable in UI)
- **Subject:** supports `all` plus specific subject IDs
- **Topic:** supports `all` plus specific topic IDs
    - Topic selector is disabled when `subject = all`

Rationale:
- Students should not cross-switch exam contexts in analytics.
- Admin can cross-scope exams; student cannot.

---

### 12.4 Mixed Tests Handling

Some tests contain multiple subjects/topics (especially mock or mixed sessions). Each question-attempt carries its own taxonomy tags.

Required behavior:
- Every attempt contributes to its own tagged subject/topic bucket.
- With `subject = all`, mixed tests influence all relevant subject rows.
- With a specific subject/topic selected, only matching attempts are included.

This prevents loss of signal from mixed sessions.

---

### 12.5 Core Aggregation Formulas

All metric formulas should be deterministic and computed from attempt-level events:

- `toPct(correct, total) = round((correct / total) * 100)` if `total > 0`, else `0`
- `totalHours = round(sum(durationSec) / 3600, 1)`
- `streakDays = count of consecutive active date keys from latest day backward`

Overview KPIs:
- `avgScore`: accuracy over filtered attempts
- `questionsAnswered`: filtered attempt count
- `streakDays`: consecutive active days
- `totalHours`: filtered study duration

Score trend:
- Group attempts by date key (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- For each day: `score = toPct(correct, total)`
- Show most recent window (e.g., last 8 points in current UI)

Subject performance:
- For each subject in selected exam:
    - `score = toPct(subjectCorrect, subjectAttempts)`

Study hours by week:
- Anchor week calculation to first attempt in filtered scope
- `weekIndex = floor(diffDays / 7)`
- Bucket to fixed display range (current UI: W1..W4)

Heatmap:
- For each subject/topic cell:
    - `score = toPct(topicCorrect, topicAttempts)`
- Color mapping:
    - Red: `< 50`
    - Yellow: `50..74`
    - Green: `>= 75`

Weakest topic summary:
- Flatten all heatmap cells in current scope
- Select minimum `score` cell

Test history row fields:
- Date, Subject Focus (`Subject: Topic`), Test Type (`Roadmap|Custom|Mock`), Score, Duration

---

### 12.6 Backend API Contract

Recommended endpoint strategy:

1. `GET /api/student/analytics/overview`
     - query: `subjectId=all|<id>&topicId=all|<id>&from=<iso>&to=<iso>`
     - response:
         - `kpis`
         - `scoreTrend[]`
         - `subjectPerformance[]`
         - `studyHoursByWeek[]`

2. `GET /api/student/analytics/matrix`
     - query: same scope fields
     - response:
         - `heatmapRows[]`
         - `weakestCell`

3. `GET /api/student/analytics/history`
     - query: same scope fields + `limit` + `cursor`
     - response:
         - paginated rows with `testType` (`roadmap|custom|mock`)

Auth requirements:
- JWT required
- `userId` derived from token, never from client query
- `examId` derived from user profile/roadmap context, not from client payload

---

### 12.7 Database Model (Recommended)

Current frontend demo uses `MOCK_STUDENT_ATTEMPTS`. Production should persist normalized analytics events.

#### 12.7.1 Attempt Event Table

```sql
CREATE TYPE test_type AS ENUM ('roadmap', 'custom', 'mock');

CREATE TABLE question_attempt_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    test_id UUID NOT NULL,
    test_type test_type NOT NULL,
    exam_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    subject_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    topic_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    question_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    duration_sec INT NOT NULL,
    answered_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_qae_user_exam_time ON question_attempt_events(user_id, exam_id, answered_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_qae_user_subject_topic ON question_attempt_events(user_id, subject_id, topic_id);
```

#### 12.7.2 Optional Daily Aggregate Table (Performance)

```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics_daily_rollups (
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    exam_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    date_key DATE NOT NULL,
    subject_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    topic_id VARCHAR(120) NOT NULL,
    attempts INT NOT NULL,
    correct INT NOT NULL,
    duration_sec INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, exam_id, date_key, subject_id, topic_id)
);
```

Use nightly/streaming jobs to maintain rollups for fast dashboards.

---

### 12.8 Event Ingestion Flow

1. Student submits test block.
2. Backend expands submission into per-question attempt events.
3. Persist into `question_attempt_events` in one transaction.
4. Emit async analytics update job (or direct upsert into daily rollup).
5. Student analytics endpoints read from rollups (preferred) or raw events.

---

### 12.9 Caching Strategy

Use Redis keying by user + exam + filter scope.

Example key:
`analytics:{userId}:{examId}:subject={subjectId}:topic={topicId}:from={from}:to={to}`

Invalidation triggers:
- new test submission for user
- manual score reprocessing
- taxonomy migration affecting IDs

TTL recommendation:
- 60s to 300s for dashboard responsiveness vs freshness.

---

### 12.10 Observability and Reliability

Frontend Phase 2 already includes:
- global window error capture
- unhandled promise rejection capture
- structured frontend logs

Analytics-specific backend telemetry should log:
- endpoint latency per scope
- cache hit ratio
- query fanout / row scan counts
- empty-state frequency by scope

SLO examples:
- P95 analytics endpoint < 400ms (cached) and < 1200ms (uncached)
- analytics error rate < 0.5%

---

### 12.11 Edge Cases (Must Handle)

1. **No attempts in scope**
     - return zero-safe KPIs and empty/fallback series
2. **Subject = all + topic selected (invalid combo)**
     - force topic to `all`
3. **Malformed historical taxonomy IDs**
     - map unknown IDs to safe labels (`Unknown Subject`, `Unknown Topic`) without breaking page
4. **Mixed tests**
     - distribute by attempt taxonomy tags (never assign whole test to one subject)
5. **Large histories**
     - use cursor pagination for history tab

---

### 12.12 Frontend Integration Notes

Current UI computes analytics client-side from mock data for demo speed.
Production transition path:

1. Keep tab and visualization components unchanged.
2. Replace local aggregations with API data hooks.
3. Keep filter UX and scope rules identical.
4. Preserve `testType` labels in history (`Roadmap|Custom|Mock`).

This guarantees minimal UI churn while backend matures.

Save rules for backend:
- Save endpoint should accept title, subject, contentMarkdown, and isPinned.
- Persist content_markdown exactly as sent from frontend.
- Derive content_plain on server side by stripping markdown markers.
- Update updated_at with server timestamp.
- Enforce ownership using authenticated user id.

Pin/Unpin contract (must implement):
- The `is_pinned` column is the single source of truth for note pin state.
- Expose `PATCH /api/v1/notes/:noteId/pin` with payload `{ "isPinned": true | false }`.
- On pin toggle, update both `is_pinned` and `updated_at`.
- Frontend list ordering should always be:
    1) `is_pinned = TRUE` first
    2) then by `updated_at DESC`
- API list queries should return rows in this order so all clients stay consistent.

Read rules for backend:
- Notes listing should support subject filter and search query.
- Search should run on content_plain and title.
- Soft-deleted notes must be excluded where deleted_at is null.

Delete rule:
- Use soft delete only (set deleted_at timestamp), do not hard delete by default.

This gives backend a reliable way to preserve exactly which text is bold or italic today, while allowing a future migration to fully structured rich text JSON.

By strictly executing this technical blueprint across Node.js, Supabase, Groq, and Redis, the NextGen Medical platform will instantaneously transition from its fully functional React User Interface Prototype directly into a scalable, high-performance SaaS enterprise application capable of supporting tens of thousands of active medical students simultaneously.

## 12. REAL-TIME ADMIN MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PRODUCTION)

This section explains exactly how the current Admin Overview frontend (KPI cards, charts, and students-needing-help table) should be wired to real users and production data in near real-time.

### 12.1 Goals and Real-Time SLAs

For Admin pages (`/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/students`, `/admin/metrics`, `/admin/financials`, `/admin/comments`), define three update speeds:

1. **Live stream (1–5s latency):**
    - Active user counters (DAU online now)
    - Moderation queue updates
    - High-risk alerts (sudden score drops, abuse spikes)

2. **Near-real-time (15–60s latency):**
    - Students-needing-help table updates
    - Score distribution updates
    - KPI snapshot refresh

3. **Batch (5–60 min latency):**
    - Financial aggregates (MRR trend, churn cohorts)
    - Most-missed-question reports
    - Deep diagnostics summaries

### 12.2 Production Architecture (High-Level)

1. **Operational Database (PostgreSQL / Supabase):**
    - Source of truth for users, tests, attempts, comments, subscriptions snapshot, moderation actions.

2. **Event Bus / Stream Layer (choose one):**
    - **Redis Streams** (fast, simpler operations) or
    - **Kafka / Redpanda** (higher scale, partitioned history).

3. **Metrics Aggregation Workers:**
    - Consumers process raw events into admin-friendly aggregates.
    - Write rolled-up metrics into dedicated read tables (materialized style).

4. **Admin API Layer (Node + Express/Fastify):**
    - Serves snapshots via REST endpoints.
    - Pushes updates via WebSocket or Server-Sent Events.

5. **Frontend Admin App (React):**
    - Initial page load from REST snapshot.
    - Real-time patch updates from WebSocket/SSE channel.

### 12.3 Event Model (What Gets Emitted)

Emit events for every key action:

- `student.login`
- `test.started`
- `test.submitted`
- `test.scored`
- `roadmap.adjusted`
- `ai.request.started`
- `ai.request.completed`
- `comment.created`
- `comment.flagged`
- `comment.hidden`
- `subscription.created`
- `subscription.renewed`
- `subscription.canceled`

Each event should include:

- `event_id` (UUID)
- `event_type`
- `occurred_at` (UTC timestamp)
- `user_id` / `admin_id` (if relevant)
- `correlation_id` (trace across services)
- `payload` (JSON)

### 12.4 Database Design for Admin Read Performance

Keep transactional tables separate from admin read models.

**Core transactional tables** (examples):
- `users`
- `test_attempts`
- `test_attempt_items`
- `video_comments`
- `subscriptions`

**Admin read-model tables** (examples):
- `admin_kpi_snapshots` (time-bucketed KPI values)
- `admin_dau_timeseries` (minute/hour buckets)
- `admin_score_distribution_buckets`
- `admin_risk_students_current`
- `admin_activity_feed_recent`
- `admin_financial_rollups_daily`
- `admin_moderation_queue_current`

This avoids heavy joins on every dashboard request and keeps chart APIs fast.

### 12.5 How Admin Overview Works with Real Data

Current UI (`AdminDashboardPage.tsx` + `admin-overview.css`) can map directly:

1. **KPI Cards:**
    - API: `GET /api/admin/overview/kpis`
    - Source: `admin_kpi_snapshots` latest row.
    - UI note: cards currently show primary values only (no delta line under each box).

2. **DAU 7-Day Line Chart:**
    - API: `GET /api/admin/overview/dau?range=7d`
    - Source: `admin_dau_timeseries`.

3. **Score Distribution Bar Chart:**
    - API: `GET /api/admin/overview/score-distribution`
    - Source: precomputed buckets from scoring pipeline.

4. **Students Needing Help Table:**
    - API: `GET /api/admin/overview/needs-help`
    - Source: risk scoring job updates `admin_risk_students_current`.

### 12.6 Real-Time Delivery: WebSocket/SSE Pattern

Recommended frontend flow for admin pages:

1. Page mount:
    - Fetch snapshot via REST.

2. Open real-time channel:
    - `GET /api/admin/stream` (SSE) **or** `wss://.../admin-stream` (WebSocket).

3. Server pushes delta messages:
    - Example message types: `kpi.updated`, `feed.new_event`, `risk.updated`, `moderation.queue.updated`.

4. Frontend applies patches:
    - Update chart series and cards in-place without full reload.

5. Reconnect strategy:
    - Exponential backoff, heartbeat ping, and stale banner if disconnected.

### 12.7 Backend Services Breakdown

Implement as logical modules (single repo or microservices):

1. **Ingestion Service:**
    - Validates and publishes domain events.

2. **Aggregation Service:**
    - Computes counters and timeseries windows (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d).

3. **Risk Scoring Service:**
    - Continuously scores students with weighted signals:
      - rolling test score,
      - study inactivity,
      - repeated weak topic failures,
      - missed roadmap sessions.

4. **Moderation Service:**
    - Handles flags, hide/show actions, audit logs.

5. **Financial Sync Service:**
    - Consumes Stripe webhooks.
    - Updates canonical subscription state + daily rollups.

### 12.8 Student Insights (Admin CRM) at Scale

For `/admin/students` production behavior:

- Use cursor pagination, not offset for large tables.
- Server-side filtering and sorting only.
- API: `GET /api/admin/students?cursor=&tier=&risk=&last_active_before=`
- Drawer endpoint: `GET /api/admin/students/:id/profile`
- Keep heavy charts summarized (14d/30d pre-aggregates).

### 12.9 Financial Monitoring (Reliable and Accurate)

Financial dashboard should be driven by Stripe events + internal ledger snapshots.

1. Stripe webhooks endpoint:
    - Verify signature.
    - Persist raw payload in `stripe_webhook_events`.
    - Idempotency by `event_id`.

2. Normalize to internal records:
    - `subscription_state`
    - `invoice_events`
    - `refund_events`

3. Rollups:
    - MRR, ARR, net revenue, churn, reactivations.

4. Reconciliation job:
    - Daily sync against Stripe API to catch missed webhooks.

### 12.10 Moderation in Real Time

For `/admin/comments`:

- New comments appear in moderation queue within seconds.
- Flag rules run async (keyword model + abuse classifier).
- Admin actions (`hide/show`) write to:
  - `video_comments.is_hidden`
  - `moderation_actions` audit table (`who`, `when`, `why`).
- Push queue size + action results to admin stream instantly.

### 12.11 Security, RBAC, and Auditability

1. **Strict RBAC:**
    - `admin`, `moderator`, `finance_admin`, `support_admin` roles.
    - Scope endpoints by role and tenant/org if needed.

2. **JWT + Session Controls:**
    - Short-lived access tokens + refresh rotation.
    - Revoke on suspicious activity.

3. **Audit log (immutable):**
    - Every admin action must produce an audit record.
    - Include IP, user-agent, request-id.

4. **PII minimization:**
    - Redact sensitive fields in general admin feeds.
    - Full PII only for privileged roles.

### 12.12 Observability and On-Call Readiness

Use OpenTelemetry + centralized logs + metrics:

- **Tracing:** request-to-event-to-worker pipeline tracing.
- **Metrics:**
  - API p95 latency,
  - stream lag,
  - worker backlog,
  - webhook failure rate,
  - DB query p95,
  - dashboard staleness age.
- **Alerts:**
  - no events ingested for N minutes,
  - admin stream disconnect spikes,
  - high queue lag,
  - Stripe webhook failure bursts.

### 12.13 Frontend Implementation Pattern (Admin React)

For each admin page:

1. `useAdminSnapshot()` hook
    - Loads initial REST payload.

2. `useAdminRealtime()` hook
    - Subscribes to channel and returns delta patches.

3. Local cache (React Query recommended)
    - Snapshot is query cache.
    - Realtime deltas mutate cache entries.

4. Staleness UX
    - Show "Live" badge when connected.
    - Show "Reconnecting" banner when disconnected.

### 12.14 Scaling Plan by Stage

1. **Stage A (0–10k users):**
    - Postgres + Redis Streams + single worker pool.

2. **Stage B (10k–100k users):**
    - Partitioned event stream, dedicated read replicas, heavier pre-aggregation.

3. **Stage C (100k+ users):**
    - Kafka/Redpanda, horizontally scaled consumers, OLAP sidecar (ClickHouse/BigQuery) for deep analytics.

### 12.15 Concrete API Contract Starter

- `GET /api/admin/overview/snapshot`
- `GET /api/admin/overview/kpis`
- `GET /api/admin/overview/dau?range=7d`
- `GET /api/admin/overview/score-distribution`
- `GET /api/admin/overview/activity?limit=50`
- `GET /api/admin/overview/at-risk?limit=50`
- `GET /api/admin/students?...filters...`
- `GET /api/admin/students/:id/profile`
- `POST /api/admin/comments/:id/hide`
- `POST /api/admin/comments/:id/show`
- `GET /api/admin/financials/summary?range=30d`
- `GET /api/admin/stream` (SSE) or `/ws/admin-stream`

### 12.16 Delivery Roadmap (Execution Order)

1. Finalize event schema + read-model tables.
2. Implement ingestion + aggregation workers.
3. Implement overview snapshot APIs.
4. Add SSE/WebSocket admin stream.
5. Wire frontend pages to snapshot + realtime hooks.
6. Implement moderation + financial reconciliation pipelines.
7. Add observability dashboards + alerts.
8. Run load tests and tune indexes/caches.

With this plan, the existing admin frontend can evolve from static demo data to true production-grade, near-real-time operational telemetry for real users.

## 13) VIDEO PROGRESS TRACKING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PRODUCTION)

This section defines exactly how to implement reliable, scalable, and fair video progress tracking so both students and admins can trust completion data.

### 13.1 Goals

1. Track watched progress per user per video accurately.
2. Resume from last valid position across devices.
3. Mark completion only when real watch criteria are met.
4. Provide admin analytics without overloading primary tables.
5. Prevent simple abuse (seek-to-end, tab-idle inflation).

### 13.2 Data Model (Backend + DB)

Use two-layer storage:

1. **State table (authoritative latest progress):**
    - `video_progress`
    - one row per `(user_id, video_id)`

2. **Event table (optional but strongly recommended):**
    - `video_watch_events`
    - append-only stream for analytics, anomaly detection, and audits.

Suggested schema (Postgres):

`video_progress`
- `id` (uuid, pk)
- `user_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `video_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `last_position_seconds` (int, default 0)
- `max_watched_seconds` (int, default 0)
- `watched_seconds_total` (int, default 0)
- `duration_seconds` (int)
- `completion_percent` (numeric(5,2), default 0)
- `is_completed` (bool, default false)
- `completed_at` (timestamptz, nullable)
- `last_event_at` (timestamptz)
- `updated_at` (timestamptz)
- unique constraint: `(user_id, video_id)`

`video_watch_events`
- `id` (uuid, pk)
- `user_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `video_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `session_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `event_type` (text: `heartbeat|pause|seek|ended|start|visibility_change`)
- `position_seconds` (int)
- `delta_watched_seconds` (int)
- `playback_rate` (numeric)
- `tab_visible` (bool)
- `client_ts` (timestamptz)
- `server_ts` (timestamptz, indexed)
- `metadata` (jsonb)

### 13.3 Completion Rules (Canonical)

Use deterministic rules to avoid ambiguity:

1. `completion_percent = (max_watched_seconds / duration_seconds) * 100`.
2. Mark complete when both are true:
    - `completion_percent >= 95` (or 90 for short clips), and
    - at least `min( duration_seconds * 0.6, duration_seconds - 30 )` valid watched time.
3. Completion is monotonic:
    - once `is_completed = true`, never revert to false.

### 13.4 API Contract

1. `GET /api/videos/:videoId/progress`
    - returns current progress row for authenticated user.

2. `POST /api/videos/:videoId/progress/events`
    - batched events endpoint (recommended every 10–20s or on pause/end).
    - body: `{ sessionId, durationSeconds, events: [...] }`

3. `PUT /api/videos/:videoId/progress/position`
    - lightweight fallback endpoint for latest position only.

4. `POST /api/videos/:videoId/progress/complete`
    - optional explicit complete endpoint for `ended` signal; backend still validates rules.

Idempotency and safety:
- Require `X-Idempotency-Key` for event batch writes.
- Ignore duplicate batch keys.
- Reject impossible jumps (example: +300 watched seconds in 5 real seconds).

### 13.5 Frontend Player Behavior (React)

On player lifecycle:

1. On load:
    - fetch progress via `GET`.
    - seek to `last_position_seconds` (bounded by duration).

2. During playback:
    - emit heartbeat every 10 seconds while all are true:
      - playing,
      - tab visible,
      - playback rate within allowed range (for example 0.75x–2x).

3. On `pause`, `seeked`, `ended`, and `beforeunload`:
    - flush pending event batch immediately.

4. Local resilience:
    - queue unsent events in memory + optional localStorage fallback.
    - retry with exponential backoff.

5. UI rules:
    - progress bar shows backend-confirmed `completion_percent`.
    - badge states: `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Completed`.

### 13.6 Anti-Gaming and Data Integrity

Validate on server, not client:

1. Cap credited watch delta by wall-clock elapsed time.
2. Do not credit watch time while tab hidden for long intervals.
3. Treat large seek forward as position change, not watched time.
4. Store both `last_position_seconds` and `max_watched_seconds`.
5. Flag anomalies:
    - extreme completion speed,
    - repetitive end-seeking patterns,
    - unrealistic concurrent sessions.

### 13.7 Admin Real-Time Monitoring Integration

Expose video-learning telemetry in admin dashboards:

1. Aggregate tables/materialized views:
    - completion rate by course/module/video,
    - median time-to-complete,
    - drop-off points by timestamp bucket.

2. Snapshot APIs:
    - `GET /api/admin/videos/overview?range=7d`
    - `GET /api/admin/videos/:videoId/funnel`
    - `GET /api/admin/videos/:videoId/dropoff`

3. Realtime:
    - publish progress updates/events to stream bus.
    - push admin delta updates via SSE/WebSocket.

### 13.8 Performance and Scaling Strategy

1. Write path:
    - ingest event batches asynchronously when traffic grows.
    - update `video_progress` in upsert transaction.

2. Read path:
    - cache `GET progress` responses (short TTL).
    - use pre-aggregated read models for admin analytics.

3. Partitioning:
    - partition `video_watch_events` by month or hash of `video_id` at scale.

4. Retention:
    - keep raw events 90–180 days (or policy-defined), then compact.

### 13.9 Security and Privacy

1. Require auth on all progress endpoints.
2. Enforce tenant and role checks for admin analytics.
3. Minimize PII in event payloads.
4. Audit admin access to individual learner progress details.

### 13.10 Rollout Plan (Recommended)

Phase A (MVP reliable progress)
1. Implement `video_progress` table + `GET/PUT` endpoints.
2. Frontend sends position on interval + pause/end.
3. Resume playback and basic completion badge.

Phase B (Robust tracking)
1. Add `video_watch_events` + batch ingestion endpoint.
2. Add anti-gaming validations and idempotency.
3. Backfill/compute improved completion metrics.

Phase C (Admin intelligence)
1. Add admin video analytics snapshot APIs.
2. Add realtime stream updates to admin dashboard.
3. Add anomaly alerts and observability metrics.

### 13.11 Test Checklist

Backend tests:
- upsert correctness for repeated batches,
- idempotency key duplicate handling,
- completion threshold transitions,
- anti-gaming validation paths.

Frontend tests:
- resume from saved position,
- heartbeat batching and flush behavior,
- offline queue + retry,
- completed badge and progress bar sync with backend response.

Load tests:
- event ingestion throughput,
- p95 latency for `GET progress`,
- stream lag for admin realtime panel.

With this implementation, video progress becomes accurate enough for learner UX, trustworthy for certification/completion logic, and actionable for real-time admin monitoring.

## 14) DOCUMENT (PDF) PROGRESS TRACKING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PRODUCTION)

This section defines robust tracking for document learning progress (PDFs, notes, handouts) so the percentage bar is accurate, resumable, and admin-reportable.

### 14.1 Goals

1. Track per-user progress per document reliably.
2. Resume users at their last meaningful reading position.
3. Prevent fake completion by fast scrolling/skipping.
4. Provide document analytics to admin in near real time.
5. Keep write path efficient under high traffic.

### 14.2 Data Model (Backend + DB)

Use two layers, same pattern as video:

1. **State table (authoritative latest progress):** `document_progress`
2. **Event table (analytics + audit):** `document_read_events`

Suggested schema (Postgres):

`document_progress`
- `id` (uuid, pk)
- `user_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `document_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `last_page` (int, default 1)
- `max_page_reached` (int, default 1)
- `page_count` (int)
- `unique_pages_read` (int, default 0)
- `active_read_seconds_total` (int, default 0)
- `completion_percent` (numeric(5,2), default 0)
- `is_completed` (bool, default false)
- `completed_at` (timestamptz, nullable)
- `last_event_at` (timestamptz)
- `updated_at` (timestamptz)
- unique constraint: `(user_id, document_id)`

`document_read_events`
- `id` (uuid, pk)
- `user_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `document_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `session_id` (uuid, indexed)
- `event_type` (text: `open|heartbeat|page_change|scroll|close|visibility_change`)
- `page_number` (int)
- `scroll_percent` (numeric(5,2), nullable)
- `delta_active_seconds` (int)
- `tab_visible` (bool)
- `client_ts` (timestamptz)
- `server_ts` (timestamptz, indexed)
- `metadata` (jsonb)

### 14.3 Completion Logic (Canonical)

Do not base completion only on final page reached.

1. `completion_percent` can be computed by weighted signal:
    - 70% weight from `max_page_reached / page_count`,
    - 30% weight from `unique_pages_read / page_count`.

2. Mark complete when all are true:
    - `completion_percent >= 90`,
    - `unique_pages_read >= ceil(page_count * 0.75)`,
    - `active_read_seconds_total >= min(page_count * 12, 900)`.

3. Completion is monotonic:
    - once complete, never revert to incomplete.

### 14.4 API Contract

1. `GET /api/documents/:documentId/progress`
    - returns progress row for authenticated learner.

2. `POST /api/documents/:documentId/progress/events`
    - accepts batched read events every 10–20s and on page-change/close.
    - body: `{ sessionId, pageCount, events: [...] }`

3. `PUT /api/documents/:documentId/progress/state`
    - lightweight fallback for last page + percent sync.

4. `POST /api/documents/:documentId/progress/complete`
    - optional explicit completion call; backend re-validates rules.

Idempotency and integrity:
- Require `X-Idempotency-Key` for event batch endpoint.
- Ignore duplicate keys and out-of-order stale updates.
- Reject impossible jumps (example: 1 → 120 pages in 2 seconds).

### 14.5 Frontend Reader Behavior (React)

For a PDF reader component/page:

1. On open:
    - fetch progress and seek to `last_page`.
    - create a `session_id` for this reading session.

2. During reading:
    - emit heartbeat every 10 seconds only if document is visible and user is active.
    - emit `page_change` events when current page changes.
    - debounce rapid scroll/page events before batching.

3. On close/unload:
    - flush pending events immediately.

4. Progress bar UI:
    - always render backend-confirmed `completion_percent`.
    - show states: `Not Started`, `Reading`, `Completed`.

5. Resilience:
    - queue unsent batches locally and retry with exponential backoff.

### 14.6 Anti-Gaming and Data Integrity

Validate server-side:

1. Credit active read time only when tab visible and user interaction exists.
2. Treat fast multi-page jumps as navigation, not read-time credit.
3. Cap credit per time window to realistic values.
4. Detect anomaly signals:
    - ultra-fast completions,
    - repetitive open-close loops,
    - extremely low dwell with high page traversal.

### 14.7 Admin Real-Time Monitoring Integration

Expose document telemetry in admin views:

1. Snapshot APIs:
    - `GET /api/admin/documents/overview?range=7d`
    - `GET /api/admin/documents/:documentId/funnel`
    - `GET /api/admin/documents/:documentId/dropoff`

2. Read models/materialized views:
    - completion by document,
    - median active read time,
    - page-level drop-off hotspots.

3. Realtime feed:
    - publish document progress deltas to stream bus.
    - surface live changes in admin dashboard via SSE/WebSocket.

### 14.8 Performance and Scalability

1. Ingest events in batches (not per scroll tick).
2. Upsert `document_progress` in a short transaction.
3. Partition `document_read_events` monthly when volume grows.
4. Keep raw events with retention policy (e.g., 90–180 days), then compact.

### 14.9 Security and Privacy

1. Auth required for all document progress endpoints.
2. Tenant/role scoping for admin visibility.
3. Do not expose sensitive document metadata unnecessarily.
4. Audit admin reads for learner-level progress records.

### 14.10 Rollout Plan (Recommended)

Phase A (MVP)
1. Add `document_progress` table.
2. Implement `GET` + lightweight `PUT` state endpoint.
3. Frontend resume + progress bar sync.

Phase B (Robust)
1. Add `document_read_events` + batched events API.
2. Add idempotency and anti-gaming validation.
3. Move completion rules fully server-side.

Phase C (Admin Intelligence)
1. Add admin document snapshot APIs and read models.
2. Stream live document progress deltas to admin UI.
3. Add anomaly alerts and observability dashboards.

### 14.11 Test Checklist

Backend tests:
- upsert behavior with duplicate and out-of-order batches,
- completion transitions at thresholds,
- impossible jump rejection,
- idempotency-key behavior.

Frontend tests:
- resume from saved page,
- heartbeat + page-change batching,
- unload flush behavior,
- progress bar reflects backend values.

Load tests:
- event ingestion throughput,
- p95 latency for `GET /progress`,
- stream lag for admin document dashboards.

With this implementation, PDF/document progress bars become trustworthy for learners, useful for admin monitoring, and robust enough for production growth.

## 15) ADMIN STUDENT OPS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PRODUCTION)

This section defines how Admin Student Operations should work end-to-end in a full-stack architecture so future developers can implement it consistently across backend, database, and frontend.

### 15.1 Objectives

1. Give admins a single operational surface to manage learners.
2. Support fast student search, triage, and intervention workflows.
3. Enable safe account/content actions with strong audit trails.
4. Provide near-real-time visibility into learner status.
5. Enforce role-based controls and compliance for sensitive operations.

### 15.2 Core Product Modules

1. **Student Directory**
    - Paginated table with filters (`cohort`, `subscription`, `risk`, `last_active`, `onboarding_status`, `completion_band`).
    - Search by name, email, phone, enrollment ID.
    - Saved filter views for support/ops teams.

2. **Student 360 Profile**
    - Identity + account state + subscription state.
    - Learning summary (test attempts, video/pdf progress, streaks, weak areas).
    - Activity timeline (auth, study events, purchases, support interactions).

3. **Operational Actions**
    - Account actions: activate/deactivate, soft suspend, force logout, password reset link trigger.
    - Learning actions: unlock/lock modules, assign remedial track, adjust deadlines.
    - Support actions: add notes, set follow-up date, assign owner.

4. **Intervention Queue**
    - Rule-based at-risk queue (low activity, low score trend, churn signals).
    - SLA tracking (`new`, `in_progress`, `resolved`, `escalated`).
    - Owner assignment and outcome logging.

5. **Bulk Operations**
    - Multi-select student actions (tag, assign cohort mentor, send reminder campaign).
    - Async job execution with progress and rollback-safe behavior.

### 15.3 Data Model (Backend + DB)

Use normalized OLTP tables plus optional read models.

Primary tables:

`students`
- `id` (uuid, pk)

- `created_at` (timestamptz, indexed)

Recommended read model tables (optional for scale):
- `student_ops_snapshot`
- `student_risk_scores`
- `student_activity_rolling_7d`

### 15.4 API Contract (Admin)

Directory and profile:
- `GET /api/admin/students?query=&status=&cohort=&risk=&subscription=&page=&limit=&sort=`
- `GET /api/admin/students/:studentId/profile`
- `GET /api/admin/students/:studentId/activity?cursor=`

Flags/notes/interventions:
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/flags`
- `PATCH /api/admin/students/:studentId/flags/:flagId`
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/notes`
- `GET /api/admin/interventions?status=&owner=&severity=&page=`
- `PATCH /api/admin/interventions/:interventionId`

Operational actions:
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/actions/activate`
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/actions/suspend`
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/actions/force-logout`
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/actions/reset-password-link`
- `POST /api/admin/students/:studentId/assignments`

Bulk actions:
- `POST /api/admin/students/bulk-actions`
  - body: `{ studentIds: [], actionType, payload, reason }`
  - returns `jobId` for async status tracking.
- `GET /api/admin/jobs/:jobId`

CSV export:
- `POST /api/admin/students/export`
  - async export job + signed download URL.

### 15.5 Business Rules and Guardrails

1. Require `reason` for all sensitive actions (`suspend`, `unlock`, `override`, `force-logout`).
2. Restrict destructive actions by role (see RBAC matrix below).
3. Enforce idempotency for action endpoints using `X-Idempotency-Key`.
4. Always write audit rows for mutation endpoints in the same transaction.
5. Do not hard-delete notes/interventions; use soft-close/archive semantics.

### 15.6 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles:
- `support_agent`
- `ops_manager`
- `super_admin`

Minimum permission policy:
- `support_agent`: read directory/profile, add notes, open intervention.
- `ops_manager`: all support permissions + assignment actions + non-destructive account actions.
- `super_admin`: all actions including suspend/reactivate, bulk critical actions, export PII-rich datasets.

Field-level access:
- PII fields (`phone`, billing identifiers) masked unless permitted.
- Audit trail read access restricted to managerial roles.

### 15.7 Frontend Implementation (Admin React)

Primary screens:
1. `AdminStudentsPage`
    - server-side table with query-state in URL.
    - sticky filters, quick chips, saved views.

2. `AdminStudentProfilePage` (or drawer)
    - tabs: `Overview`, `Learning`, `Billing`, `Timeline`, `Notes`, `Interventions`.
    - action bar with guarded action buttons.

3. `AdminInterventionsPage`
    - queue board/list by status with owner filters and SLA badges.

Suggested frontend data layer:
- React Query for REST snapshots.
- SSE/WebSocket hook for delta updates:
  - online state,
  - intervention changes,
  - latest activity ping.

UX guardrails:
- confirmation modal for high-impact actions,
- inline rationale input where required,
- optimistic UI only for reversible actions.

### 15.8 Realtime Architecture

Event producers:
- auth events,
- learning progress events,
- payments/subscription events,
- admin mutation events.

Pipeline:
1. append domain event,
2. update read models,
3. publish admin delta to SSE/WebSocket channels (`students`, `interventions`, `alerts`).

Frontend behavior:
- snapshot on load,
- patch with deltas,
- reconnect with backoff,
- show `Live`/`Reconnecting` indicators.

### 15.9 Observability and Operations

Metrics:
- `admin_student_query_p95_ms`
- `admin_action_write_p95_ms`
- `intervention_open_count`
- `bulk_job_failure_rate`
- `audit_write_failure_rate`
- realtime connection health and stream lag

Alerts:
- elevated mutation failure rate,
- missing audit writes,
- export job backlog,
- realtime disconnect spikes.

Logs/tracing:
- request tracing with `request_id`,
- structured action logs including `actor`, `target`, `action_type`.

### 15.10 Security and Compliance

1. Enforce SSO/MFA for admin accounts.
2. Session hardening for admin panel (shorter TTL, IP/device risk checks).
3. Encrypt sensitive fields at rest where required.
4. Record immutable audit logs and protect against tampering.
5. Add privacy-safe defaults for exports and profile views.

### 15.11 Delivery Roadmap (Execution Order)

Phase A (Foundation)
1. Implement core tables + migrations.
2. Build student directory + profile read APIs.
3. Render frontend directory with filters and profile panel.

Phase B (Operations)
1. Add mutation endpoints (notes, flags, assignments, account actions).
2. Add audit logging and reason enforcement.
3. Add intervention queue and ownership workflow.

Phase C (Scale + Realtime)
1. Introduce read models and async bulk job pipeline.
2. Add SSE/WebSocket updates across admin student ops views.
3. Add observability dashboards and alerting.

### 15.12 Test Strategy

Backend tests:
- RBAC matrix enforcement,
- audit row persistence for every mutation,
- idempotency behavior,
- transactional integrity for action + audit writes,
- bulk action partial-failure handling.

Frontend tests:
- filter/query-state behavior,
- guarded action flows (reason + confirmation),
- optimistic update rollbacks,
- realtime patch handling and reconnect state.

Integration/load tests:
- high-cardinality student directory queries,
- concurrent admin mutations on same student,
- SSE/WebSocket fanout under peak ops usage.

With this plan, Admin Student Ops becomes a production-safe operational system: fast for daily support workflows, secure for sensitive actions, and auditable for compliance and accountability.

### 15.13 Screen-by-Screen Metric Mapping (Current UI)

This subsection maps every visible Student Ops element (as currently shown in `AdminStudentsPage`) to backend and DB implementation so there is no ambiguity during full-stack build.

#### A) KPI Strip (Top Cards)

1. **Total Students**
     - UI meaning: count of all students visible to the admin tenant/scope.
     - Backend source: `COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE tenant_id = :tenantId AND deleted_at IS NULL`.
     - Update cadence: near-real-time (refresh every 60s + push deltas).

2. **Tier Count Cards (Dynamic)**
    - UI meaning: one card for each tier currently configured in billing (`demo` + all paid tiers).
    - Backend source:
        - entitlement/subscription snapshot joined with billing plan config.
    - Adaptation rule:
        - if tiers are added/removed in billing config, card set updates automatically.

#### B) Directory Summary

3. **"N matching students"**
     - UI meaning: result count after applying all filters/search.
     - Backend source:
         - `GET /api/admin/students` returns `{ rows, total, filteredTotal }`.
     - Pagination note:
         - `total` = full population in scope.
         - `filteredTotal` = count after current filter predicates.

#### C) Student Table Columns

4. **Name + Email**
     - DB: `students.full_name`, `students.email`.
     - Search index: trigram/full-text on name + case-insensitive prefix on email.

5. **Cohort**
     - DB: `cohorts.name`, joined via `students.cohort_id`.

6. **Tier**
      - Derived field from entitlement/subscription state + billing tier configuration.
      - Legacy compatibility rule in UI:
      - `trial -> demo`
      - unknown legacy paid states map to default paid tier.

7. **Avg Score**
        - DB/read model:
            - aggregate from `student_test_attempts` over configured window (e.g., last 30 days),
            - persisted in `student_ops_snapshot.avg_score_30d`.

8. **Last Active**
        - DB/read model:
            - max event timestamp from `student_activity_events`,
            - denormalized to `student_ops_snapshot.last_active_at`.
        - UI formatting: relative time derived client-side from server timestamp.

#### D) Right Panel Student Profile Analytics

9. **Tier Badge**
    - shows resolved tier for the selected student.
    - consistency rule: must use same resolver/data payload as table row tier.

10. **Meta fields (cohort, roadmap, phone)**
        - `cohort`: cohorts table.
        - `roadmap stage`: `student_roadmap_progress.current_stage_label`.
        - `phone`: `students.phone` (PII-masked by role policy).

11. **Video Progress bar**
        - computed from `video_progress` aggregated by assigned curriculum scope.
        - formula (example):
            $$
            video\_progress\_pct = \frac{\sum completed\_video\_units}{\sum assigned\_video\_units} \times 100
            $$

12. **PDF Progress bar**
        - computed from `document_progress` (see section 14).
        - formula (example):
            $$
            pdf\_progress\_pct = \frac{\sum completed\_document\_units}{\sum assigned\_document\_units} \times 100
            $$

13. **Test Completion bar**
        - derived from assigned tests vs completed tests (or question-bank targets).
        - formula:
            $$
            test\_completion\_pct = \frac{completed\_assigned\_tests}{total\_assigned\_tests} \times 100
            $$

#### E) Current Simplification Scope

14. Current frontend `AdminStudentsPage` intentionally focuses on insights only:
    - no admin action buttons,
    - no notes composer/list,
    - no interventions list,
    - no recent activity timeline.
    These can be reintroduced later as separate modules once backend workflows are finalized.

### 15.14 Backend Analytics Computation Plan (Minute-Level)

To support “minute analytics” without heavy query load, implement a dual-path model:

1. **Hot path (stream updates, 15–60s):**
     - consume domain events from queue (`auth`, `learning`, `billing`, `ops`),
     - increment counters in Redis/materialized cache,
     - push deltas to connected admin clients via SSE/WebSocket.

2. **Warm path (batch reconciliation, every 5–15m):**
     - recalculate snapshot metrics from canonical DB,
     - compare with hot counters,
     - repair drift and republish corrected snapshot.

3. **Cold path (daily rebuild):**
     - nightly full recomputation of `student_ops_snapshot` and `student_risk_scores`.

Recommended workers:
- `student-activity-aggregator`
- `student-risk-scorer`
- `intervention-sla-worker`
- `subscription-state-sync-worker`

### 15.15 API Response Shapes (Recommended)

`GET /api/admin/students`
- response:
    - `rows[]` (table rows with profile summary fields),
    - `total`, `filteredTotal`,
    - `kpis` (total + dynamic `tierCounts` object),
    - `serverTime`, `snapshotVersion`.

`GET /api/admin/students/:id/profile`
- response:
    - identity/meta,
    - progress metrics (`videoProgressPct`, `pdfProgressPct`, `testCompletionPct`),
    - resolved tier for badge display.

`GET /api/admin/students/stream` (SSE)
- event types:
    - `kpi.updated`,
    - `student.updated`,
    - `tier.updated`.

### 15.16 DB/Read-Model Additions for Current UI

Add/ensure these read-model tables for fast page loads:

`student_ops_snapshot`
- one row per student + tenant,
- columns:
    - `student_id`, `tenant_id`,
    - `resolved_tier_id`,
    - `avg_score_30d`,
    - `last_active_at`,
    - `video_progress_pct`, `pdf_progress_pct`, `test_completion_pct`,
    - `updated_at`.

`student_ops_kpi_snapshot`
- one row per tenant/time window,
- columns:
    - `tenant_id`, `window_start`,
    - `total_students`,
    - `tier_counts_json`,
    - `updated_at`.

Indexes:
- on `student_ops_snapshot(tenant_id, resolved_tier_id, last_active_at)`
- on `student_activity_events(student_id, event_ts desc)`

### 15.17 Monitoring and Alerting for Each Analytic

Metric correctness monitors:
1. `kpi_drift_active_today` = abs(hot_counter - batch_recompute)
2. `kpi_drift_at_risk`
3. `kpi_drift_open_interventions`
4. `snapshot_staleness_seconds`
5. `risk_score_compute_lag_seconds`

Operational monitors:
1. `student_stream_connected_clients`
2. `student_stream_reconnect_rate`
3. `student_profile_query_p95_ms`
4. `student_directory_query_p95_ms`
5. `admin_action_failure_rate`
6. `audit_write_failure_rate`

Alerts (example thresholds):
- snapshot staleness > 180s for 5m,
- KPI drift > 3% for two consecutive reconciliations,
- profile query p95 > 800ms,
- stream reconnect rate spike > baseline × 3,
- any non-zero audit write failures over 5m.

### 15.18 Frontend State Strategy for This Page

Use three query domains:
1. `students:list` (filters + pagination + KPI bundle)
2. `students:profile:{id}`
3. `students:stream` (SSE/WebSocket patches)

Patch rules:
- apply stream deltas to cache,
- if delta version gap detected, trigger full refetch,
- preserve selected student where possible.

UX fallbacks:
- show stale badge when snapshot age > 2 minutes,
- disable risky actions while stream disconnected + stale data.

### 15.19 Action Lifecycle (Suspend Example)

1. Admin clicks suspend with reason.
2. Frontend calls `POST /actions/suspend` with idempotency key.
3. Backend transaction:
     - update `students.status`,
     - append `admin_actions_audit`,
     - append domain event.
4. Worker updates read models.
5. Stream emits `student.updated` + `kpi.updated`.
6. Frontend reflects row/status chip, profile badge, KPI changes.

### 15.20 Data Freshness and Consistency Contract

Define and document SLOs:
- directory/profile snapshot freshness: < 60s,
- action-to-UI propagation: p95 < 5s,
- risk recomputation freshness: < 15m,
- KPI drift after reconciliation: < 1% steady-state.

This keeps expectations explicit for both product and engineering.

### 15.21 Expanded Test Matrix (Minute Analytics + Ops)

Backend:
- verify KPI formulas against fixture datasets,
- verify drift correction reconciles hot vs canonical counters,
- verify action side effects: status + audit + event,
- verify idempotent retries do not double-apply actions.

Frontend:
- verify filters produce expected query params,
- verify KPI cards update after stream deltas,
- verify profile bars match backend percent values,
- verify notes/interventions/activity lists stay ordered by newest-first.

End-to-end:
- create intervention → observe KPI and profile change within SLA,
- suspend student → row chip, profile badge, and KPI update,
- simulate stream disconnect/reconnect and ensure cache resync.

With these additions, every Student Ops analytic currently shown in the UI has a defined data contract, computation path, monitoring strategy, and operational lifecycle for production implementation.

## 16) ADMIN METRICS + FINANCIALS + COMMENTS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PRODUCTION)

This section documents the complete implementation plan for the Admin Metrics, Admin Financials, and Comment Moderation capabilities that were built in frontend demo mode and then refined to stay tightly aligned with `docs/description.md`.

It also includes the student-side comment submission/display flow that feeds moderation.

### 16.1 Scope Alignment (Description-First)

This plan is intentionally constrained to the requirements in Module E of `docs/description.md`:

1. **Global Metrics & Averages**
2. **Financial & Subscriptions Overview**
3. **Ability to Control Display of Comments** (admin show/hide)

Anything beyond those three is optional and should not block delivery.

### 16.2 What Is Implemented in Frontend Demo Today

Implemented pages:

1. `/admin/metrics`
         - KPI strip (global engagement/performance snapshot)
         - Engagement trend chart
         - Score distribution chart
         - Weekly activity snapshot table

2. `/admin/financials`
         - KPI strip for revenue/subscription health
         - Revenue + MRR trend chart
         - Subscription plan mix chart
         - Payment reconciliation feed (invoice status table)

3. `/admin/comments`
         - Moderation queue with filters
         - Comment detail panel
         - Single moderation action: **Show/Hide**
         - Moderation action history log

4. `/student/comments`
         - Student comment submission form
         - Student-visible comments list (visible only)
         - Copy and UX aligned to “comments” terminology

### 16.3 Data Contracts (Current Frontend Dummy Mode)

Core frontend dummy data source:

- `/frontend/src/data/adminMetricsFinancials.ts`
- `/frontend/src/data/adminCommentModeration.ts`

Current moderation model:

```ts
type ModerationStatus = 'visible' | 'hidden'

interface ModerationComment {
    id: string
    author: string
    text: string
    status: ModerationStatus
    createdAt: string
    actionHistory: ModerationActionLog[]
}
```

Important: There is no status complexity beyond `visible|hidden`.

### 16.4 Admin Metrics Page Plan (`/admin/metrics`)

#### A) KPI Semantics

Keep KPIs global and operationally useful:

1. Daily Active Users
2. Practice Tests Submitted (7d)
3. Study Sessions Completed (7d)
4. Avg Test Accuracy

#### B) Visual Panels

1. **Engagement Trend** (line)
2. **Score Distribution** (bar)
3. **Weekly Activity Snapshot** (table)

#### C) Production API Mapping

- `GET /api/admin/metrics/summary?range=30d`
- `GET /api/admin/metrics/engagement?range=30d`
- `GET /api/admin/metrics/score-distribution?range=30d`
- `GET /api/admin/metrics/weekly-activity?range=30d`

### 16.5 Admin Financials Page Plan (`/admin/financials`)

#### A) KPI Scope (Refined)

To stay practical and spec-safe, financial KPIs now focus on revenue and subscription state.

Current intended KPI set:

1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
2. Annual Run Rate (ARR)
3. Active Paid Subscribers

Removed to reduce implementation complexity and scope drift:

- Net Churn Rate
- Refund Rate
- Failed Payments (as top KPI)

Note: failed/refunded states still appear in invoice table where useful.

#### B) Visual Panels

1. **Revenue + MRR Trend**
2. **Subscription Plan Mix**
3. **Payment Reconciliation Feed**

#### C) Production API Mapping

- `GET /api/admin/financials/summary?range=30d`
- `GET /api/admin/financials/revenue-trend?range=6m`
- `GET /api/admin/financials/plan-mix?range=30d`
- `GET /api/admin/financials/invoices?status=&cursor=`

### 16.6 Admin Comment Moderation Plan (`/admin/comments`)

#### A) Product Rule (Non-Negotiable)

From `docs/description.md`:

> Admin can choose which comments are shown and which are hidden.

Therefore moderation action set is intentionally minimal:

1. Show Comment
2. Hide Comment

No extra moderation states (escalated, approved, triaged) are required for MVP.

#### B) UI Contract

1. Queue with search + status filter
2. Selected comment detail
3. Show/Hide toggle button
4. Action history list

#### C) Production API Mapping

- `GET /api/admin/comments?status=visible|hidden|all&query=&cursor=`
- `PATCH /api/admin/comments/:commentId/visibility`
    - payload: `{ "status": "visible" | "hidden", "reason": "..." }`
- `GET /api/admin/comments/:commentId/history`

### 16.7 Student Comments Flow Plan (`/student/comments`)

#### A) Student UX

1. Student posts comment (`name + text` in demo mode)
2. Comment appears in visible list
3. Admin can later hide it from moderation page
4. Hidden comments are excluded from student-visible list

#### B) Production API Mapping

- `POST /api/student/comments`
    - payload: `{ "text": "..." }` (author should come from auth context in production)
- `GET /api/student/comments?status=visible`

#### C) Ownership Rules

1. Student can create comments
2. Student can view visible comments
3. Admin controls visibility globally

### 16.8 Database Plan (Production)

Recommended core table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE comments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('visible','hidden')),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Recommended audit table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE comment_moderation_actions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    comment_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES comments(id),
    actor_admin_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('show','hide')),
    reason TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 16.9 End-to-End Action Lifecycle (Hide Comment)

1. Admin clicks **Hide Comment** in `/admin/comments`.
2. Frontend sends `PATCH /api/admin/comments/:id/visibility`.
3. Backend transaction:
         - updates `comments.status = 'hidden'`
         - inserts audit row in `comment_moderation_actions`
4. Student comments API excludes hidden comment.
5. Admin queue reflects updated visibility immediately.

### 16.10 Realtime (Optional Upgrade)

Not required for MVP, but easy extension:

1. Publish moderation events on show/hide.
2. Push updates over SSE/WebSocket to admin + student clients.
3. Auto-refresh queue/list without manual reload.

### 16.11 Testing Checklist

#### Frontend

1. Metrics and Financials pages render on desktop/mobile.
2. Financial KPI cards match refined set (no churn/refund/failed KPI cards).
3. Student comment page submits and renders new comment.
4. Admin show/hide updates status and history in UI.

#### Backend (when implemented)

1. Visibility patch endpoint enforces admin-only access.
2. Hidden comments never appear in student-visible endpoint.
3. Every moderation action writes audit row.
4. Filters/search return stable, paginated results.

### 16.12 Delivery Phases

Phase A (already done in frontend demo):
1. Admin Metrics UI + dummy data
2. Admin Financials UI + dummy data
3. Admin Comment Moderation (show/hide only)
4. Student Comments page and left-nav route

Phase B (backend wiring):
1. Add comments and moderation tables
2. Add admin/student comments endpoints
3. Replace dummy data with API fetching

Phase C (operational hardening):
1. Add RBAC + immutable audit pipeline
2. Add realtime updates (optional)
3. Add observability, alerts, and load tests

With this plan, Admin Metrics + Financials + Comments remain practical, spec-aligned, and straightforward to ship to production without overengineering.

## 17) EXAM → SUBJECT → TOPIC TAXONOMY ANALYTICS (FULL PRODUCTION BLUEPRINT)

This chapter defines the exact implementation model for taxonomy-driven analytics, where every metric is computed from question-level outcomes mapped to:

1. exam
2. subject
3. topic

This section is written so a future backend engineer can build the full production stack without ambiguity.

### 17.1 Problem Statement and Non-Negotiable Rules

#### A) What must be true

1. Every question belongs to exactly one `exam`, one `subject`, and one `topic`.
2. Every submitted test attempt stores per-question outcomes.
3. Analytics at exam/subject/topic level are derived from question outcomes, not guessed from test-level totals.
4. A subject/topic metric is always scoped to one exam taxonomy.
5. Roadmap tests, custom tests, and mock tests all feed the same analytics pipeline.

#### B) Why this matters

Without question-level taxonomy tagging, admin metrics (engagement, weak topics, risk, distribution) become noisy and non-actionable. The platform must answer:

- “How are students performing in `Exam X > Subject Y > Topic Z`?”
- “Which topics are weak globally for this exam cohort?”
- “Which students are disengaging in a specific topic?”

### 17.2 Canonical Domain Model

Use strict normalized entities:

1. `exams`
2. `exam_subjects`
3. `subject_topics`
4. `question_bank`
5. `tests`
6. `test_question_map`
7. `test_attempts`
8. `attempt_question_results`

Core identity principle:

- `question_id` is the atomic analytics unit.
- Topic-level metrics are computed by aggregating all `attempt_question_results` for questions mapped to that topic.

### 17.3 Database Schema (Authoritative)

#### A) Taxonomy tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE exams (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    code VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,            -- e.g. USMLE_STEP1
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE exam_subjects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    code VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,                   -- e.g. PATHOLOGY
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    display_order INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (exam_id, code)
);

CREATE TABLE subject_topics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exam_subjects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    code VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,                   -- e.g. CARDIO_SHOCK
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    display_order INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    difficulty_band VARCHAR(32),                 -- optional metadata
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (subject_id, code)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_exam_subjects_exam ON exam_subjects(exam_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_subject_topics_subject ON subject_topics(subject_id);
```

#### B) Question and test composition

```sql
CREATE TYPE test_source AS ENUM ('roadmap', 'custom', 'mock', 'diagnostic');

CREATE TABLE question_bank (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exams(id),
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exam_subjects(id),
    topic_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES subject_topics(id),
    external_ref VARCHAR(255),
    stem TEXT NOT NULL,
    difficulty SMALLINT,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_question_taxonomy ON question_bank(exam_id, subject_id, topic_id);

CREATE TABLE tests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- nullable for system-generated sets
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exams(id),
    source test_source NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE test_question_map (
    test_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tests(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES question_bank(id),
    question_order INT NOT NULL,
    marks NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    PRIMARY KEY (test_id, question_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_tqm_test ON test_question_map(test_id, question_order);
```

#### C) Attempt storage (must be question-level)

```sql
CREATE TYPE attempt_status AS ENUM ('started', 'submitted', 'abandoned');

CREATE TABLE test_attempts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    test_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tests(id),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exams(id),
    source test_source NOT NULL,
    status attempt_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'started',
    started_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    time_spent_seconds INT,
    total_questions INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    correct_answers INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    score_percentage NUMERIC(5,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_attempts_exam_submitted ON test_attempts(exam_id, submitted_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_attempts_user_submitted ON test_attempts(user_id, submitted_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_attempts_source ON test_attempts(source);

CREATE TABLE attempt_question_results (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    attempt_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES test_attempts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    question_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES question_bank(id),
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exams(id),
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES exam_subjects(id),
    topic_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES subject_topics(id),
    is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    obtained_marks NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    max_marks NUMERIC(6,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    time_spent_seconds INT,
    answered_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE (attempt_id, question_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_aqr_exam_subject_topic_time
    ON attempt_question_results(exam_id, subject_id, topic_id, answered_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_aqr_topic_time ON attempt_question_results(topic_id, answered_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_aqr_attempt ON attempt_question_results(attempt_id);
```

### 17.4 Write Path: What Happens on Test Submit

When a student submits a test:

1. Backend validates auth and ownership (`attempt.user_id == token.user_id`).
2. Backend locks the attempt row (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) to prevent duplicate submit.
3. Backend fetches canonical question mapping from `test_question_map` + `question_bank`.
4. For each answer, backend writes one `attempt_question_results` row with exam/subject/topic IDs.
5. Backend computes attempt totals:
   - `total_questions = N`
   - `correct_answers = C`
   - `score_percentage = (C / N) * 100`
6. Backend marks attempt `status='submitted'` and writes `submitted_at`.
7. Backend emits domain event `attempt.submitted`.

All seven steps run in a single DB transaction.

### 17.5 Aggregation Model (How Engagement/Accuracy Are Calculated)

Use dual strategy:

1. **Hot path (near realtime):** incremental counters for admin dashboards.
2. **Cold path (reconciliation):** periodic recompute from canonical rows.

#### A) Required aggregate tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics_topic_daily (
    date_key DATE NOT NULL,
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL,
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL,
    topic_id UUID NOT NULL,
    total_attempted_questions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_correct_questions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    unique_students BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_time_seconds BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (date_key, exam_id, subject_id, topic_id)
);

CREATE TABLE analytics_subject_daily (
    date_key DATE NOT NULL,
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL,
    subject_id UUID NOT NULL,
    total_attempted_questions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_correct_questions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    unique_students BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (date_key, exam_id, subject_id)
);

CREATE TABLE analytics_exam_daily (
    date_key DATE NOT NULL,
    exam_id UUID NOT NULL,
    total_attempts BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_attempted_questions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    total_correct_questions BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    unique_students BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (date_key, exam_id)
);
```

#### B) Metric formulas (authoritative)

- Topic accuracy:
  $$\text{topicAccuracyPct} = \frac{\text{totalCorrectQuestions}}{\text{totalAttemptedQuestions}} \times 100$$
- Topic engagement:
  $$\text{topicEngagementCount} = \text{uniqueStudents who attempted topic in window}$$
- Subject accuracy and engagement are the same formulas aggregated across all topics in the subject.
- Exam-level values aggregate across all subjects and topics under that exam.

#### C) Weak-topic classification

Suggested baseline rule (configurable):

1. minimum volume gate: `total_attempted_questions >= 30`
2. weak threshold: `accuracy < 55%`
3. severe threshold: `accuracy < 40%`

Store thresholds in config table, not hardcoded constants.

### 17.6 Backend Services and Jobs

#### A) Synchronous service (API)

- `AssessmentSubmissionService`
  - validates submission,
  - persists canonical results,
  - publishes `attempt.submitted` event.

#### B) Async workers

1. `AttemptAggregationWorker`
   - consumes `attempt.submitted`,
   - updates daily aggregate tables with upsert increments.
2. `AnalyticsReconciliationWorker` (hourly/nightly)
   - recomputes aggregates for recent window (e.g., last 7 days),
   - compares computed vs stored totals,
   - repairs drift if mismatch exceeds tolerance.
3. `RiskScoringWorker`
   - computes student risk by trend + inactivity + weak-topic density.

### 17.7 API Contracts for Admin Metrics (Taxonomy-Aware)

All endpoints require admin auth and support the same filter grammar:

- `examId` (required)
- `subjectId` (optional)
- `topicId` (optional)
- `from`, `to` (date window)
- `source` (optional: `roadmap|custom|mock|diagnostic|all`)

#### A) Taxonomy discovery

1. `GET /api/admin/taxonomy/exams`
2. `GET /api/admin/taxonomy/exams/:examId/subjects`
3. `GET /api/admin/taxonomy/subjects/:subjectId/topics`

#### B) KPI summary

`GET /api/admin/metrics/summary?examId=...&subjectId=...&topicId=...&from=...&to=...`

Response should include:

- `attemptsCount`
- `studentsEngaged`
- `accuracyPct`
- `avgTimePerQuestionSec`
- `weakTopics[]` (when scope is exam/subject)

#### C) Trend and distribution

1. `GET /api/admin/metrics/engagement-trend`
2. `GET /api/admin/metrics/accuracy-trend`
3. `GET /api/admin/metrics/score-distribution`
4. `GET /api/admin/metrics/weekly-activity`

All responses must echo back normalized scope object:

```json
{
  "scope": {
    "examId": "...",
    "subjectId": "...",
    "topicId": "...",
    "source": "all",
    "from": "2026-04-01",
    "to": "2026-04-30"
  }
}
```

### 17.8 Frontend/Backend Synchronization Contract

Frontend currently simulates this in:

- `/frontend/src/data/examTaxonomy.ts`
- `/frontend/src/data/mockStudentAttempts.ts`
- `/frontend/src/services/simulatedAiEngine.ts`
- `/frontend/src/components/taxonomy/TaxonomyFilterBar.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminMetricsPage.tsx`

To move from simulation to production, preserve the same interaction flow:

1. UI selects `exam`.
2. UI fetches subjects for exam.
3. UI selects `subject` (optional).
4. UI fetches topics for subject.
5. UI selects `topic` (optional).
6. UI requests metrics using current scope.
7. Backend returns scope-normalized payload + computed metrics.

#### A) Frontend state invariants

1. If `examId` changes, clear `subjectId` and `topicId`.
2. If `subjectId` changes, clear `topicId`.
3. Do not send `topicId` without `subjectId`.
4. Disable metric calls until required scope (`examId`) exists.

#### B) Cache strategy

- Cache taxonomy trees (`exams`, `subjects`, `topics`) with long TTL.
- Cache metrics queries by full filter key (`examId+subjectId+topicId+range+source`).
- Invalidate metrics cache on filter change or explicit refresh.

### 17.9 Data Integrity and Guardrails

#### A) Integrity constraints

1. `question_bank.exam_id` must match test exam.
2. `attempt_question_results.*_id` must match canonical question taxonomy.
3. Submit endpoint must reject attempts where submitted question list differs from assigned test question map.

#### B) Idempotency

- Use idempotency key per submission (`attemptId` + final hash).
- Repeated submit calls must not double-write `attempt_question_results`.

#### C) Time-window correctness

- Use UTC everywhere in storage and aggregation.
- Derive `date_key` with explicit timezone policy (UTC).

### 17.10 RBAC and Security

1. Student endpoints can only write/read their own attempts.
2. Admin metrics endpoints require `role='admin'`.
3. Audit log each admin analytics request for sensitive cohort slices (optional but recommended in regulated environments).
4. Do not expose question stems/answers in admin metrics APIs unless explicitly required.

### 17.11 Observability and Operational SLOs

Track these metrics:

1. `attempt_submit_success_rate`
2. `attempt_submit_p95_latency`
3. `aggregation_worker_lag_seconds`
4. `aggregation_reconciliation_drift_count`
5. `metrics_api_p95_latency`

Alerting recommendations:

- page if submission success drops below 99.5% over 10 minutes,
- page if worker lag > 300s for 15 minutes,
- warn if drift repairs exceed threshold daily.

### 17.12 Migration Plan from Current Frontend Simulation

#### Phase 1 (already done)

- Frontend taxonomy simulation and AI-like insights.

#### Phase 2 (backend foundation)

1. Create taxonomy + question + attempt tables.
2. Implement test submit endpoint with question-level persistence.
3. Implement taxonomy read endpoints.

#### Phase 3 (analytics)

1. Add aggregate tables + worker.
2. Implement metrics endpoints for exam/subject/topic scopes.
3. Validate formulas against fixture datasets.

#### Phase 4 (cutover)

1. Replace simulated engine calls with real API calls.
2. Keep payload shapes stable to minimize frontend diffs.
3. Run dual-read verification (simulated vs real) for short window in staging.

### 17.13 Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

This feature is complete only when all statements below are true:

1. A student submits any test type (`roadmap/custom/mock`) and per-question results are persisted with exam/subject/topic IDs.
2. Admin can filter by exam only and see valid aggregated metrics.
3. Admin can filter by exam+subject and see narrowed metrics.
4. Admin can filter by exam+subject+topic and see precise metrics.
5. Weak-topic detection uses configured thresholds and minimum volume gates.
6. Aggregation worker is idempotent and reconciliation repairs drift.
7. API responses include explicit scope echo to prevent frontend mismatch.
8. RBAC blocks non-admin access to admin analytics endpoints.

With this blueprint, future backend development for taxonomy analytics is fully specified across schema, pipelines, services, API contracts, synchronization behavior, and operational guardrails.

### 17.14 Frontend Phase 1 Implementation Contract (Now Implemented)

This subsection records what is already implemented in frontend for Phase 1 (Exam Taxonomy Alignment), and the exact payload/contract backend should support for seamless cutover.

#### A) Implemented frontend files

1. `frontend/src/components/student/create-test/AutoTestBuilder.tsx`
     - exam/subject/topic selectors are taxonomy-driven from `EXAM_TAXONOMY`,
     - exam change resets subject+topic,
     - subject change resets topic,
     - start action navigates with `testBlueprint` route state.

2. `frontend/src/pages/student/TestSessionPage.tsx`
     - reads `testBlueprint`,
     - scopes questions to `examId+subjectId+topicId` (with fallback to subject/exam pools),
     - produces per-question submission rows with taxonomy IDs and `testType`,
     - forwards results to review page.

3. `frontend/src/pages/student/TestReviewPage.tsx`
     - consumes submitted question results,
     - renders scope-aware score header,
     - derives weakest topic from incorrect-rate in submitted payload.

4. `frontend/src/pages/student/AnalyticsPage.tsx`
     - uses taxonomy filter (`exam + subject + topic`),
     - computes KPI/trends/heatmap/history from filtered attempt rows,
     - preserves dependent reset logic across filter levels.

5. `frontend/src/data/questions.ts`
     - question objects now carry canonical taxonomy IDs/labels.

6. `frontend/src/data/createTest.ts`
     - introduces canonical `TestBlueprint` contract with `testType` + scope IDs.

#### B) Canonical frontend contracts

```ts
type TestMode = 'Tutor' | 'Timed'
type TestType = 'roadmap' | 'custom' | 'mock'

interface TestBlueprint {
    examId: string
    examLabel: string
    subjectId: string
    subjectLabel: string
    topicId: string
    topicLabel: string
    questionCount: number
    mode: TestMode
    testType: TestType
}

interface SubmittedQuestionResult {
    questionId: string
    examId: string
    subjectId: string
    topicId: string
    testType: TestType
    selectedChoiceId: string
    isCorrect: boolean
    durationSec: number
}
```

#### C) Frontend handoff expectations for backend APIs

When backend endpoints are introduced, frontend should send `SubmittedQuestionResult[]` payload semantics exactly (field names can remain identical to minimize mapping logic).

Recommended submit endpoint contract:

```http
POST /api/student/tests/:testId/submit
```

Request body shape expected by frontend integration:

```json
{
    "testBlueprint": {
        "examId": "usmle-step1",
        "subjectId": "pharma",
        "topicId": "autonomic-drugs",
        "questionCount": 20,
        "mode": "Tutor",
        "testType": "roadmap"
    },
    "submittedQuestionResults": [
        {
            "questionId": "q1",
            "examId": "usmle-step1",
            "subjectId": "pharma",
            "topicId": "autonomic-drugs",
            "testType": "roadmap",
            "selectedChoiceId": "B",
            "isCorrect": true,
            "durationSec": 60
        }
    ]
}
```

#### D) Synchronization rules backend must honor

1. Validate that each `questionId` actually belongs to provided `examId/subjectId/topicId`.
2. Reject mixed-exam submissions in one attempt.
3. Compute official correctness server-side; do not trust client `isCorrect` blindly.
4. Persist `testType` per attempt row to allow roadmap/custom/mock slice analytics.
5. Return scope echo in responses so frontend can detect mismatched filters.

#### E) Cutover plan (frontend already prepared)

1. Replace local route-state submission in `TestSessionPage.tsx` with API call.
2. Keep `TestReviewPage.tsx` shape-compatible by returning `submittedQuestionResults` from backend response.
3. Replace local analytics derivation in `AnalyticsPage.tsx` with API response mapper while keeping existing view models unchanged.

This gives a low-risk migration path: backend can be introduced without redesigning the current frontend state machine.

## 18) ADMIN ANNOUNCEMENTS + STUDENT INBOX (FULL PRODUCTION BLUEPRINT)

This chapter defines exactly how global admin announcements should work end-to-end so every student receives them in an inbox experience.

It covers:
- Frontend architecture
- Backend APIs and contracts
- Database schema and indexing
- Read/unread semantics
- Delivery, observability, and edge-case handling

---

### 18.1 Product Goal and User Stories

Primary requirement:
- Admin can create one announcement.
- All students can see it in their inbox.
- Students can mark single message or all messages as read.

Core user stories:
1. **Admin broadcast:** As an admin, I write and send an announcement visible to all students.
2. **Student inbox visibility:** As a student, I see all announcements in reverse chronological order.
3. **Read tracking:** As a student, unread/read status is tracked per student, not globally.
4. **Notification hint:** Student topbar badge reflects unread count.

---

### 18.2 Current Frontend Implementation (Already Added)

Implemented files:

1. `frontend/src/context/AnnouncementContext.tsx`
     - Shared announcement store/state.
     - Supports:
         - `postAnnouncement()`
         - `unreadCount(studentKey)`
         - `isRead(studentKey, announcementId)`
         - `markAsRead(studentKey, announcementId)`
         - `markAllAsRead(studentKey)`
     - Persists demo data to localStorage:
         - `announcements.v1`
         - `announcementReadsByStudent.v1`

2. `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminAnnouncementsPage.tsx`
     - Admin form for title + message.
     - Broadcast history list.
     - Basic KPI cards (total, latest broadcast).

3. `frontend/src/pages/student/InboxPage.tsx`
     - Inbox list of all announcements.
     - Read/unread badge per row.
     - "Mark as read" and "Mark all as read" actions.

4. `frontend/src/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx`
     - Adds sidebar nav entry: `/admin/announcements`.

5. `frontend/src/layouts/StudentLayout.tsx`
     - Adds sidebar nav entry: `/student/inbox`.
     - Topbar bell routes to inbox and shows unread count badge.

6. `frontend/src/App.tsx`
     - Wires routes:
         - `/admin/announcements`
         - `/student/inbox`
     - Wraps app with `AnnouncementProvider`.

Frontend styles:
- `frontend/src/styles/admin/admin-announcements.css`
- `frontend/src/styles/student-inbox.css`

---

### 18.3 Production Data Model (Database)

Use normalized tables with explicit per-student read tracking.

#### 18.3.1 Announcements table

```sql
CREATE TABLE announcements (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
        title VARCHAR(220) NOT NULL,
        message TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_by_admin_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
        status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'published',
        published_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_announcements_published_at ON announcements(published_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_announcements_status ON announcements(status)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

Recommended status enum values:
- `draft`
- `published`
- `archived`

For MVP where send is immediate, you may skip `draft` and write directly as `published`.

#### 18.3.2 Per-student read tracking table

```sql
CREATE TABLE announcement_reads (
        announcement_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES announcements(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        student_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        read_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        PRIMARY KEY (announcement_id, student_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_announcement_reads_student_time
ON announcement_reads(student_id, read_at DESC);
```

This table is essential: read status must be user-specific.

#### 18.3.3 Optional delivery snapshot table (large scale)

```sql
CREATE TABLE announcement_delivery_snapshots (
        announcement_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES announcements(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        recipient_count BIGINT NOT NULL,
        read_count BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
        unread_count BIGINT NOT NULL,
        computed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Use this only when admin analytics need fast read-rate dashboards.

---

### 18.4 Backend API Contracts

Base path suggestion: `/api/v1`

#### 18.4.1 Admin endpoints

1. Create announcement

```http
POST /api/v1/admin/announcements
```

Request:

```json
{
    "title": "Platform maintenance window",
    "message": "System maintenance is scheduled for Sunday 01:00-01:20 UTC.",
    "publishNow": true,
    "expiresAt": null
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "id": "a7f6d2ab-98fd-4667-9b52-54f3d9477db9",
    "status": "published",
    "publishedAt": "2026-04-12T11:18:20.000Z"
}
```

2. List announcements (admin)

```http
GET /api/v1/admin/announcements?status=published&cursor=<token>&limit=20

```json
{
    "status": "archived"
}
```

#### 18.4.2 Student endpoints

1. Inbox list

```http
GET /api/v1/student/inbox?cursor=<token>&limit=20
```

Response shape:

```json
{
    "rows": [
        {
            "id": "a7f6d2ab-98fd-4667-9b52-54f3d9477db9",
            "title": "Platform maintenance window",
            "message": "System maintenance is scheduled for Sunday 01:00-01:20 UTC.",
            "createdBy": "Admin",
            "publishedAt": "2026-04-12T11:18:20.000Z",
            "isRead": false,
            "readAt": null
        }
    ],
    "unreadCount": 3,
    "nextCursor": null
}
```

2. Mark one announcement read

```http
POST /api/v1/student/inbox/:announcementId/read
```

Idempotent behavior required: repeated calls should not create duplicates.

3. Mark all announcements read

```http
POST /api/v1/student/inbox/read-all
```

Response:

```json
{
    "updated": 12,
    "unreadCount": 0
}
```

### 18.5 Query Logic (Read/Unread Computation)

Student inbox query pattern:

```sql
SELECT
    a.id,
    a.title,
    a.message,
    a.published_at,
    au.first_name || ' ' || au.last_name AS created_by,
    (ar.read_at IS NOT NULL) AS is_read,
    ar.read_at
FROM announcements a
JOIN users au ON au.id = a.created_by_admin_id
LEFT JOIN announcement_reads ar
    ON ar.announcement_id = a.id
 AND ar.student_id = :student_id
WHERE a.status = 'published'
    AND au.role = 'admin'
    AND a.deleted_at IS NULL
    AND (a.expires_at IS NULL OR a.expires_at > NOW())
ORDER BY a.published_at DESC
LIMIT :limit;
```

Unread count pattern:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS unread_count
FROM announcements a
LEFT JOIN announcement_reads ar
    ON ar.announcement_id = a.id
 AND ar.student_id = :student_id
WHERE a.status = 'published'
    AND a.deleted_at IS NULL
    AND (a.expires_at IS NULL OR a.expires_at > NOW())
    AND ar.announcement_id IS NULL;
```

---

### 18.6 Delivery Lifecycle (How It Works End-to-End)

1. Admin submits title + message from `/admin/announcements`.
2. Backend validates payload and stores new row in `announcements` as `published`.
3. Student inbox endpoint includes this row for every student immediately.
4. Student opens inbox (`/student/inbox`) and fetches rows + unread count.
5. Student clicks "Mark as read": backend upserts into `announcement_reads`.
6. Unread badge decrements in UI (from API response refresh or optimistic update).
7. "Mark all as read" inserts missing read rows in batch.

Important: this model does **not** duplicate announcement rows per student.
Read state is represented by join + sparse read table.

---

### 18.7 Caching and Real-Time Strategy

Recommended caching:
- Cache student inbox list and unread count by `studentId` for short TTL (30–120s).
- Invalidate on:
    - new published announcement
    - mark-read
    - mark-all-read

Redis key examples:
- `inbox:{studentId}:page:{cursor}:{limit}`
- `inbox:{studentId}:unreadCount`

Optional real-time push:
- Use WebSocket/SSE channel `student:{studentId}:announcements` to push "new announcement" events.
- On event, trigger inbox refetch and badge refresh.

---

### 18.8 Security and Access Control

Must enforce these rules:

1. Only admin role can call admin announcement create/archive endpoints.
2. Student endpoints must derive `studentId` from JWT; never trust client-provided IDs.
3. Sanitization and max length checks:
     - `title` max 220 chars
     - `message` max (for example) 5000 chars
4. Keep immutable audit fields:
     - who created announcement
     - when published
5. Soft-delete (`deleted_at`) for legal/audit traceability.

---

### 18.9 Observability and SLOs

Track metrics:
- `announcement.create.success_rate`
- `announcement.create.latency_p95`
- `student.inbox.fetch.latency_p95`
- `student.inbox.unread_count.calc.latency_p95`
- `student.inbox.mark_read.success_rate`

Operational logs:
- announcement id
- admin id
- student id (for read actions)
- correlation id

Suggested SLOs:
- P95 inbox fetch < 500ms (cached) and < 1200ms (uncached)
- Mark-read success > 99.9%
- Announcement publication propagation < 5s for online students

---

### 18.10 Edge Cases (Must Handle)

1. **Student with zero announcements**
     - Return empty list and unread count = 0.

2. **Duplicate read event**
     - Upsert semantics must keep operation idempotent.

3. **Announcement expires**
     - Expired rows must disappear from inbox queries.

4. **Announcement archived after student read**
     - Keep read audit row; hide from active inbox list.

5. **Large announcement volume**
     - Use cursor pagination, not offset for deep scroll.

6. **Out-of-order client refreshes**
     - Server remains source of truth for unread count.

---

### 18.11 Frontend-to-Backend Cutover Plan

Current frontend uses localStorage-backed context (demo mode). Cutover steps:

1. Keep `AnnouncementContext` public API unchanged.
2. Replace localStorage read/write internals with API calls.
3. Preserve route structure and pages:
     - `/admin/announcements`
     - `/student/inbox`
4. Keep unread badge behavior identical.
5. Add optimistic UI for read actions with rollback on API failure.

Because UI contracts are already stable, backend integration can be done with minimal UI churn.

---

### 18.12 Implementation Checklist (Production)

Backend:
- [ ] Create `announcements` and `announcement_reads` tables + indexes.
- [ ] Implement admin create/list/archive endpoints.
- [ ] Implement student inbox/list/read/read-all endpoints.
- [ ] Add auth middleware role checks and ownership enforcement.
- [ ] Add integration tests for read/unread transitions.

Frontend:
- [ ] Replace demo persistence with API service layer.
- [ ] Keep `AnnouncementContext` as single client state orchestrator.
- [ ] Add loading/error/empty states for inbox and admin form.
- [ ] Add retry/error toasts for failed read actions.

Operations:
- [ ] Add metrics + logs + alert thresholds.
- [ ] Add Redis caching and invalidation hooks.
- [ ] Define retention policy for archived announcements.

This completes the production blueprint for a scalable, auditable admin announcement system with a student inbox that supports accurate per-user read state.

---

## 19. TIERED SUBSCRIPTIONS + DEMO TRIAL (PRODUCTION BLUEPRINT)

This chapter is the authoritative specification for taking the current frontend-only tier/trial implementation into fully synchronized production with backend, database, billing provider, and secure entitlement enforcement.

### 19.1 Product Rules (Non-Negotiable)

Source of truth for current implementation is frontend code:
- `frontend/src/types/subscription.ts`
- `frontend/src/services/subscription/subscriptionService.ts`
- `frontend/src/services/subscription/localSubscriptionRepository.ts`
- `frontend/src/context/SubscriptionContext.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminBillingSettingsPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/billing/FeatureGate.tsx`

Note: this chapter defines production backend contracts while preserving current frontend behavior.

Plans:
- **Demo Trial** (time-limited, auto-start on first login)
- **Basic**
- **Standard**
- **Premium**

Core business behavior:
1. User lands on marketing page, creates account, logs in.
2. On first authenticated session, trial starts automatically.
3. Trial duration default is 7 days (admin editable).
4. All paid plans (`basic`, `standard`, `premium`) are currently 30-day access windows in frontend mode.
5. User can upgrade during trial or after expiry.
6. Current frontend blocks restricted resources via `FeatureGate` + local entitlement snapshot.
7. In production, backend entitlement must become final authority for all premium resource access.
8. Frontend must show discoverable lock states and upgrade CTA, not silent hiding.

### 19.2 Target Production Architecture

#### Frontend
- React app keeps current `SubscriptionContext` public API.
- Context becomes orchestration layer only (no business authority).
- Feature checks use server-sourced entitlement snapshot.

#### Backend API
- Node.js/TypeScript API becomes entitlement authority.
- JWT-authenticated endpoints return signed entitlement and plan capabilities.
- All protected business endpoints re-check entitlement server-side.

#### Database
- PostgreSQL stores plans, pricing versions, user subscriptions, trial lifecycle, feature grants.
- Billing events (webhooks) are persisted and replay-safe.

#### Billing Provider
- Stripe (or equivalent) for checkout/subscription lifecycle.
- Webhooks are idempotent and authoritative for payment state.

### 19.3 Canonical Domain Model

#### Enum: `plan_id`
- `demo`
- `basic`
- `standard`
- `premium`

#### Enum: `subscription_status`
- `trialing`
- `active`
- `past_due`
- `canceled`
- `expired`

#### Enum: `feature_key`
- `dashboard_basic`
- `adaptive_limited`
- `adaptive_full`
- `mock_exam_limited`
- `mock_exam_full`
- `analytics_basic`
- `analytics_advanced`
- `peer_matching`
- `leaderboard`
- `marathon_preview`
- `marathon_full`
- `priority_support`

### 19.4 Recommended Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TYPE plan_id AS ENUM ('demo', 'basic', 'standard', 'premium');
CREATE TYPE subscription_status AS ENUM ('trialing', 'active', 'past_due', 'canceled', 'expired');

CREATE TABLE billing_settings (
  id SMALLINT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1,
  demo_duration_days INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 7,
  updated_by UUID,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  CONSTRAINT demo_days_range CHECK (demo_duration_days BETWEEN 1 AND 30)
);

CREATE TABLE plan_catalog (
  plan plan_id PRIMARY KEY,
  display_name VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  monthly_price_cents INT NOT NULL,
  currency VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'USD',
  is_most_popular BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE plan_feature_grants (
  plan plan_id NOT NULL,
  feature_key VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (plan, feature_key)
);

CREATE TABLE user_subscriptions (

```

### 19.5 Plan Access Matrix (Production Contract)

Current frontend defaults from `DEFAULT_BILLING_SETTINGS`:
- `demo`: `adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`
- `basic`: `adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`
- `standard`: `adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`, `analytics_basic`
- `premium`: all configurable frontend gates (`adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`, `analytics_basic`, `peer_matching`, `leaderboard`)

Admin can override tier feature toggles in `AdminBillingSettingsPage` for the configurable gate set.

#### Demo Trial
- Allowed (current default): `adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited` (quota)
- Locked by default: `analytics_basic`, `peer_matching`, `leaderboard`
- Production extension options (when backend enables full matrix): `analytics_advanced`, `marathon_preview`, `marathon_full`, `priority_support`

#### Basic
- Allowed (current default): `adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`
- Locked by default: `analytics_basic`, `peer_matching`, `leaderboard`
- Production extension options: `analytics_advanced`, `marathon_preview`, `marathon_full`, `priority_support`

#### Standard
- Allowed (current default): `adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`, `analytics_basic`
- Locked by default: `peer_matching`, `leaderboard`
- Production extension options: `adaptive_full`, `mock_exam_full`, `analytics_advanced`, `priority_support`

#### Premium
- Current frontend default: all configurable gates unlocked (`adaptive_limited`, `mock_exam_limited`, `analytics_basic`, `peer_matching`, `leaderboard`).
- Production target: all canonical features unlocked.

### 19.6 Entitlement Resolution Algorithm (Server)

On each authenticated request:
1. Load active/trial subscription row for `user_id`.
2. If none exists and user is first-time active session, create trial row.
3. If `now > trial_ends_at` and plan is demo, transition status to `expired`.
4. If `now > current_period_end` for paid plans, transition status to `expired`.
5. Compute granted features using `plan_feature_grants` + trial status checks.
6. Return signed entitlement payload to frontend.

Pseudo-shape returned by API:

```json
{
  "plan": "standard",
  "status": "active",
  "trial": {
     "startedAt": null,
     "endsAt": null,
     "remainingDays": 0,
     "isExpired": false
  },
    "grants": ["adaptive_full", "mock_exam_full", "analytics_basic", "analytics_advanced"],
  "limits": {
     "demoMockExamsRemaining": 0
  },
  "version": "2026-04-13T18:00:00Z"
}
```

### 19.7 Required Backend API Contracts

#### Student-facing
1. `GET /api/v1/billing/entitlement`
    - Returns current entitlement snapshot.

2. `GET /api/v1/billing/plans`
    - Returns active plans and display prices.

3. `POST /api/v1/billing/checkout-session`
    - Creates provider checkout session for selected plan.

4. `POST /api/v1/billing/portal-session`
    - Opens subscription management portal.

#### Admin-facing
1. `GET /api/v1/admin/billing/settings`
2. `PUT /api/v1/admin/billing/settings`
    - Update fixed frontend-visible prices and demo duration.

3. `GET /api/v1/admin/billing/plans`
4. `PUT /api/v1/admin/billing/plans/:planId`

#### Webhook
1. `POST /api/v1/webhooks/stripe`
    - Verify signature.
    - Persist event in `billing_events`.
    - Apply idempotent subscription state transition.

### 19.8 Payment + Subscription Lifecycle

#### Trial start
- Trigger: first successful login for student with no active subscription.
- Action: create `user_subscriptions` with `plan='demo'`, `status='trialing'`, set `trial_ends_at`.

#### Upgrade during trial
- User selects plan in frontend.
- Backend creates checkout session.
- On successful payment webhook:
  - set `plan='basic|standard|premium'`
  - `status='active'`
    - set paid period end (currently 30 days in frontend simulation)
  - clear trial-only restrictions.

#### Expiry handling
- Evaluated on read and via nightly job.
- If expired and still demo:
  - set `status='expired'`
  - limit access to upgrade-eligible routes only.
- If expired and paid plan:
    - set `status='expired'`
    - limit access to upgrade/renewal routes only.

#### Cancellation
- Provider event sets `status='canceled'` but user may retain access until period end.

### 19.9 Frontend-Backend Synchronization Contract

Current frontend adapter pattern is already correct for migration:
- `SubscriptionRepository` = boundary
- `LocalSubscriptionRepository` = temporary local mode
- Production replacement = `ApiSubscriptionRepository`

Cutover strategy:
1. Keep `SubscriptionContext` and UI components unchanged.
2. Replace storage adapter only.
3. Ensure all gating reads server entitlement response.
4. Keep optimistic UX for purchase button, but final truth from webhook-refreshed entitlement.

Refresh cadence:
- Pull entitlement on login, app boot, and route transitions into protected areas.
- Revalidate every 60–120s while app is active.
- Force refresh after checkout success redirect.

### 19.10 Security and Enforcement Requirements

1. **Never trust frontend gating.**
    - Every protected backend endpoint checks entitlement before serving data.

2. **Webhook idempotency is mandatory.**
    - Use unique `provider_event_id` constraint.

3. **JWT payload should not be sole source of entitlement.**
    - JWT can include snapshot hints, but backend must verify against DB.

4. **Auditability.**
    - Record all entitlement transitions and admin pricing changes.

5. **RLS/authorization policy.**
    - Students can only read their own subscription row.
    - Only admin role can mutate billing settings/catalog.

### 19.11 Operational Jobs

1. **Nightly expiry reconciler**
    - Marks stale trial and paid subscriptions as `expired`.

2. **Billing drift reconciler**
    - Compares provider state with DB and fixes mismatches.

3. **Trial limits reconciler**
    - Ensures trial usage counters and entitlement state are consistent.

### 19.12 Observability and Alerts

Metrics:
- `billing.entitlement.fetch.latency.p95`
- `billing.checkout.create.success_rate`
- `billing.webhook.process.success_rate`
- `billing.webhook.idempotent.duplicates`
- `subscription.expired.users.count`

Alerts:
- webhook failure rate > 1%
- entitlement fetch p95 > 500ms
- checkout success drop > 20% day-over-day

### 19.13 Migration Plan from Current Frontend Demo Mode

Phase 1 (current):
- LocalStorage entitlements + admin setting simulation.

Phase 2:
- Introduce API endpoints and DB tables.
- Keep local adapter fallback for development.

Phase 3:
- Swap frontend adapter to API.
- Enable checkout and webhook processing.

Phase 4:
- Harden server-side gates for all premium resources.
- Add integration tests and end-to-end billing tests.

### 19.14 Developer Checklist (Backend Onboarding)

- [ ] Create DB schema in section 19.4.
- [ ] Seed `plan_catalog` and `plan_feature_grants` from section 19.5.
- [ ] Implement entitlement resolver algorithm (19.6).
- [ ] Build API endpoints (19.7).
- [ ] Add Stripe webhook processor with idempotency (19.7, 19.8).
- [ ] Implement nightly reconciliation jobs (19.11).
- [ ] Add audit logs + admin mutation history.
- [ ] Add integration tests:
  - first login trial start
  - trial expiry redirect
  - upgrade during trial
  - downgrade/cancel behavior
  - admin price update propagation

This chapter is the production contract for subscriptions: if implemented as specified, frontend, backend, and DB will remain aligned and low-risk to evolve.

## 20. FRONTEND↔README DEEP SYNC AUDIT REPORT (2026-04-20)

### 20.1 Phase Changelog (What Was Updated In-Place)

Phase A — Global status labeling:
- Added document-level status legend and chapter reality map.
- Added explicit implementation-status labels to major chapter headers.

Phase B — Accuracy corrections for active frontend domains:
- Updated Chapter 11 with current notes reality (in-memory simulation, no backend persistence yet).
- Updated Chapter 19 source-of-truth pointers to actual frontend files.
- Corrected Chapter 19 behavior language to distinguish current frontend gating vs production server authority.
- Corrected Chapter 19.5 access matrix to reflect current `DEFAULT_BILLING_SETTINGS` and configurable gate set.

Phase C — Delivery/reporting:
- Added this audit report section with changelog, out-of-scope list, definition of done, and coverage report.

### 20.2 Removed / Marked Out-of-Scope (Current Frontend Reality)

Not implemented in current frontend and therefore treated as blueprint-only:
- Live backend integrations (Supabase/Redis/Stripe/Groq APIs).
- JWT-authenticated server enforcement.
- Production cron/reconciliation jobs.
- Real DB-backed persistence for announcements, subscriptions, notes, analytics events.

Still valid as backend implementation contracts (kept intentionally):
- SQL schema proposals.
- API contracts and payload shapes.
- Security/observability/operational requirements.

### 20.3 Definition of Done for This Sync Pass

This deep sync pass is considered done when:
1. Every major README chapter is explicitly labeled by implementation status.
2. Current implemented frontend features are not described as already backend-live.
3. Chapter 18 and Chapter 19 document current frontend behavior plus production cutover contracts.
4. Contradictions against current route/context/service behavior are removed or clarified.

### 20.4 Final Coverage Report

Matched to current frontend (implemented or accurately marked partial):
- Routing and gated pages in `frontend/src/App.tsx`.
- Student/admin auth context behavior in `StudentAuthContext` and `AdminAuthContext`.
- Announcement flow in `AnnouncementContext`, `AdminAnnouncementsPage`, `InboxPage`.
- Subscription/trial engine in `SubscriptionContext`, `SubscriptionService`, `AdminBillingSettingsPage`, `FeatureGate`.
- Student analytics UI/formulas in `AnalyticsPage` and related components.

Missing in frontend (left as backend blueprint work):
- Real API transport adapters for announcements/subscriptions/analytics/notes.
- Persistent server-side entitlement and billing webhook processing.
- Production-grade observability and reconciliation jobs.

Result:
- README is now aligned to current frontend state without full-file overwrite.
- Backend teams can distinguish immediately between live frontend behavior and planned production contracts.

## 21. FRONTEND CHANGE LEDGER (ADDITIONS / REMOVALS / BEHAVIOR CHANGES)

This ledger captures the larger set of concrete frontend changes so backend handoff has a granular implementation map.

### 21.1 Routing and Surface Area Additions

Implemented routes in `frontend/src/App.tsx` include:

Student:
- `/student/dashboard`
- `/student/roadmap`
- `/student/create-test`
- `/student/qbank`
- `/student/test-session`
- `/student/test-review`
- `/student/tutor`
- `/student/content`
- `/student/comments`
- `/student/inbox`
- `/student/flashcards`
- `/student/analytics`
- `/student/leaderboard`
- `/student/partners`
- `/student/notes`
- `/student/upgrade`

Admin:
- `/admin/dashboard`
- `/admin/students`
- `/admin/metrics`
- `/admin/financials`
- `/admin/comments`
- `/admin/announcements`
- `/admin/billing`

### 21.2 Authentication and Access Control Reality

Student auth (`StudentAuthContext`):
- Login accepts any non-empty email in demo mode.
- Student profile persists to `localStorage` key `studentUser`.
- Onboarding completion state is tracked locally.
- Legacy tier migration logic maps prior values (e.g., `pro` -> `standard`, `elite` -> `premium`).

Admin auth (`AdminAuthContext`):
- Demo credential gate is hardcoded.
- Persisted admin session uses `localStorage` key `adminUser`.

Route protection:
- `StudentProtectedRoute` redirects non-onboarded users to onboarding.
- Expired plan snapshots redirect students to `/student/upgrade`.
- `AdminProtectedRoute` guards all admin pages by local admin session state.

### 21.3 Subscription, Billing, and Gate Behavior

Current architecture:
- Entitlements are resolved in frontend via `SubscriptionService` + `LocalSubscriptionRepository`.
- Billing settings persist in `localStorage` and are editable via `/admin/billing`.
- Cross-tab billing setting sync is implemented through `storage` event handling in `SubscriptionContext`.

Observed business rules in current frontend code:
- Demo trial defaults to 7 days (admin-configurable 1..30).
- Paid plans are modeled as 30-day windows in simulation mode.
- Demo mock exam quota is enforced (`1` in current implementation).
- Feature gates for currently wired routes focus on:
    - `adaptive_limited`
    - `mock_exam_limited`
    - `analytics_basic`
    - `peer_matching`
    - `leaderboard`

### 21.4 Announcements and Inbox Additions

Implemented behavior:
- Admin broadcast creation and history in `/admin/announcements`.
- Student inbox with per-student read/unread tracking in `/student/inbox`.
- Read model uses localStorage-backed keys:
    - `announcements.v1`
    - `announcementReadsByStudent.v1`
- Student topbar bell badge shows unread count from `AnnouncementContext`.

### 21.5 Student Learning Module Reality

Roadmap:
- `/student/roadmap` currently uses hardcoded weekly plan data.
- Timeline adjuster and onboarding-driven display are implemented in frontend.

Test flow:
- Create/test session/review are live in UI.
- Submission currently builds local result payloads and navigates route-state, not backend writes.

Analytics:
- KPI/trend/heatmap/history derived from mock attempt dataset.
- Taxonomy filtering is implemented client-side.

Tutor:
- `AiTutorPage` uses rotating preset responses and placeholder citation panel.
- No live RAG/network inference path is currently wired.

Content Hub:
- Video/PDF preview UX implemented with placeholder/demo assets.
- Client-side PDF dwell-time-based progress increment is simulated in component state.

Flashcards:
- Daily deck generation implemented via `flashcardsEngine` using mock attempt patterns.
- Session progress and card status are local session state.

Notes:
- Rich note editing interactions are implemented.
- Save/Pin/Delete are currently in-memory component updates (no backend persistence).

### 21.6 Admin Module Reality

Admin Overview (`/admin/dashboard`):
- KPI + chart panels rendered from local `adminOverview` data.

Student Insights (`/admin/students`):
- Search/filter/detail drawer behavior implemented.
- Tier grouping resolves dynamically from billing settings + simulated student records.

Global Metrics (`/admin/metrics`):
- Taxonomy-scoped simulated model derived from mock attempts via `simulatedAiEngine`.

Financials (`/admin/financials`):
- Revenue/MRR/plan-mix/invoice feed are currently dummy data panels.

Comments Moderation (`/admin/comments` + `/student/comments`):
- Frontend supports show/hide visibility workflow and local moderation action log.
- Student comments page allows posting in demo mode and displays visible entries.

### 21.7 Explicitly De-Scoped/Not Yet Wired (Important for Backend)

Not implemented yet in current frontend integration layer:
- Real API transport layer for major domains (auth, analytics, notes, announcements, billing).
- Live provider webhook processing integration.
- Server-authoritative entitlement checks from frontend requests.
- Real-time sockets/SSE integration for admin operational streams.
- Persistent server-side storage for most currently simulated module datasets.

### 21.8 Backend Handoff Priority (Execution Order)

Recommended high-impact backend wiring order:
1. Subscription entitlement endpoints + billing settings endpoints (aligns route gates).
2. Announcements inbox endpoints (already stable context contract).
3. Test submission + analytics read endpoints (replace mock derivations).
4. Notes persistence endpoints.
5. Admin metrics/financial/comment moderation APIs with auditability.

This ledger should be treated as the practical handoff delta between frontend simulation and production backend implementation.
